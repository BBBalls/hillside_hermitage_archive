171hh- The Beautiful side of Ugly, the Living side of Death
-----------------------------------------------------------

**Q:** AN 7.49:

> What seven?\
> 1-The perception of the ugly,\
> 2- the perception of death,\
> 3- the perception of the other side(paṭikūlasaññā) of food/eating,\
> 4- the perception of non-delight in regard to the whole world,\
> 5- the perception of anicca,\
> 6- the perception of dukkha in anicca,\
> 7- the perception of anatta in dukkha.

The term \"​*paṭikūla*\"​ is usually translated as \'repulsive\' but
it\'s literally the \'other/opposite side\'.

**Nm:**​ It\'s the side that is simultaneously there with the beautiful.
And in order to discern it, you need to see through the beauty that is
present. The opposite side of beauty cannot be found somewhere else.
Like, two sides of a coin, you don\'t seek a second coin to see the
other side of this coin. It\'s the same coin but now you need to see the
opposite side, the one you\'re not looking at. And the reason why
that\'s so important is that the most common way people practice
*asubha*​ is as a response to the beautiful, as in, they want to get rid
of the beautiful and replace it with the ugly. Which means you see those
things as separate from each other. You\'re not seeing the ugly within
that beautiful, which is how you would cancel(undermine) the attraction
to the beautiful, by seeing the opposite side of it (within it). But
instead, you\'re just trying to get rid of the beautiful because it
bothers you and replace it with ugly because that supposedly does not
bother you or it shouldn\'t bother you as much if you want to practice
restraint. But in reality, what you\'re doing, is just acting on account
of how you feel.

So the beauty is there bothering you and you just want to be free from
bother, which is fine. But how do you go about it? You go about blaming
the beautiful for the disturbance. Which means you don\'t really know
where the bother is and it\'s not in the beautiful. The lustful
attraction is not in the beautiful. It\'s in your attitude towards it.

**Q:**​ Because you don\'t see the nature of that beautiful thing
that\'s why you\'re attracted to it.

**Nm:**​ Exactly, and you will not see its nature, because now you think
\"the attraction is in the beautiful, so all I need to do is replace the
beautiful with images of ugly, and then I\'m free from attraction\". No,
and that\'s exactly what happened to many monks who were practising
wrongly. They started getting attracted to the ugly, to the disgusting
things, to corpses and so on. Because they were wrongly attending.

The right attention it\'s how you attend those things, within them. So
while beautiful is present, you have a chance to discern correctly,
​\'*yonisomanasikara*\',​ to attend correctly, to attend to the opposite
side that\'s there implicitly. Which is why freedom from the side that
is beautiful is possible. You don\'t have to do anything in response to
it, you just need to see through it. And that\'s why, if you actually
develop that ​\'*patikulamanasikara*\'​, it then doesn\'t matter, what
type of beautiful perception you encounter, later on, the mind remains
equally developed in regard to it, the mind sees through it, because it
has seen through its nature which is universal. And when you see through
the nature of beauty, as inseparable from ugly, then you realize that
the beautiful is just less ugly, not as ugly, but still ugly. Which
means it starts serving as a basis for dispassion.

**Q:**​ So how do you cultivate the perception of ugly or these other
perceptions that the Buddha has encouraged? How would you establish your
mind in the ugly right now? How would you do that? How would you discern
the opposite side?

**Nm:**​ You need to check your mind,\" Is there lust here now?\", as
in, is there presently enduring attraction to beautiful, right here,
right now? Then the answer is no, but then, could there be lust in your
mind, as in, in the future, \"Is my mind liable to become attracted
again to something of sensual nature?\"

The point is, you want to recognize that the possibility of lust,
aversion, delusion, manifesting in your experience is already the lust,
aversion, delusion, in your experience, just on a subtler level. How
would you know this possibility of lust arising in the future unless
that possibility of lust is already present right here, right now, which
is how you know it.

The possibility of lust is there because the basis for lust is there,
you haven\'t abandoned it. So circumstantially, you\'re not
particularly, experiencing any lust right here right now. But the whole
basis, the whole domain of being liable to lust is still there. You
haven\'t abandoned it. So can these things arise in the future? Yes,
means you\'re presently maintaining the basis, and when the conditions
are right, lust will arise on account of the basis that is being
maintained.

What is the basis for lust arising?

**Q:** ​Valuing of pleasure

**Nm:**​ Exactly, so you\'re not engaging in any sensual pleasure now,
yet you\'re maintaining the view that that pleasure is valuable. Which
is enough to maintain the basis for future lust to arise. However, if
you see the extent of the danger of that wrong view that pleasure is
valuable, you will free yourself from sensuality. As the Buddha once
said, \"For as long as I did not understand the extent of the danger in
regard to gratification, I did not claim to be fully free from sensual
desires. But when I understood the danger, then I understood the escape,
then I claimed to be fully free from sensual desires\".

So within the beautiful, the opposite side of the beautiful is the
danger defined by that beautiful. The danger is the attraction to the
beautiful which is based upon the ​*asubha*/​ the ugly.

The development of that perception of danger means the discernment of
the implicit characteristics of what you are attending. The chief of
those characteristics being the danger. Having discerned the implicit
danger long enough, you will not need to maintain that perception
because it\'s not something that you created, it\'s something that you
have uncovered.

**Q:** ​The sutta continues:

> \"2-\... When a Bhikkhu becomes accustomed to the perception of death,
> their mind draws back from attachment to life, and either upekkha or
> the other side gets established\...\
> (continues as above)\...\"

**Nm:**​ The perception of death is the counterpart of this life here,
you can\'t just get rid of life in order to see what death is, which is
how people usually practice, ​*asubha*​, get rid of the ​subha and then
replace it with ​*asubha*.​

So \'the other side\' means that it\'s there simultaneously present at
the same time within whatever you\'re attending. Death is simultaneously
present as the other side of life. Even if you don\'t attend to it
necessarily. You\'re not attending the fact that you\'re alive, you\'re
just taking it for granted. That doesn\'t matter, in its nature, death
is implicit. And it wouldn\'t be implicit if there is no life. In the
same sense, the ugly would not be implicit if there were no beautiful.

So instead of following the direction that taking your life for granted,
offers, you start discerning that - whenever there is life, death is
implicit. You will then experience disenchantment with life, and it will
be impossible for you to remain attracted to it.

**Q:**​ The result of seeing death then is that whatever is happening in
life won\'t bother you because the passion for it has been removed.

**Nm:**​ Yes, because passion is not the product of life. Passion is the
product of you thinking or having a view, that life is yours, that life
is in your control, that life is not subject to change, that life will
not end, that our life will last forever. All those are implicit notions
that you have towards life. And hence passion.

If you remove the misconceptions towards life, there is no longer a
basis for passion. But, again, as I said, you cannot remove the
misconceptions by denying life. You cannot remove misconceptions about
the beautiful by trying to constantly get rid of it and deny it. You
remove misconceptions by allowing beautiful to endure and then seeing
through it.

If a sensual thought manifests, it says in the suttas that one must \"
obliterate it, destroy it, get rid of it\...etc\". But how do you do
that? It doesn\'t say that you must deny its existence. No. You get rid
of it by not welcoming it, by not delighting in it, by not entertaining
it. That\'s how you get rid of it \'indirectly\', so to speak. You get
rid of the sensual thought or you get rid of the intoxication with life,
by not carelessly welcoming it, delighting in it, entertaining it. So
when it arises on its own, you must not welcome it, which doesn\'t mean
that you must go out of your way and try and chase it away. No, you must
just make sure that you remain mindful of not welcoming it with any
gesture, and if you do that long enough, the thing will go away.

**Q:** ​And again, you don\'t have to go and seek out death or
possibility of death because it\'s already there.

**Nm:**​ If you seek it out, it means you still imply with your view
that the problem is in those individual things that you\'re now seeking
out to prove to yourself that you are not subjected to them. Just ask
yourself, \"Am I subject to this?\" Yes. So what is there to seek out
when it\'s already here? Can future lust manifest in me in the future?
I\'m not sure, means yes. Unless you know that it can\'t, that\'s the
basis for - Yes it can. So if you seek out individual examples of lust
to prove to yourself that you\'re not lustful, means you\'re lustful,
and you still think the problem is in those individual things that you
perceive, not in your mind of welcoming, delighting, entertaining.

So you can ask, am I subject to death? Will I be affected if my life
were to end next second? Yes, there you go. I don\'t know. There you go.
You will. So how can you then free yourself from death without denying
life by seeing the danger in life and removing slightest passion towards
life, while life is still there? And then you know, it\'s the passion
that kept me bound to life, that keeps you subject to death. Not life in
itself. Hence freedom from life is possible without needing to die. And
that\'s why when you do die as the Buddha would say, you will not be
reappearing anywhere else. Because you have severed any bond with the
entire domain of samsara.

Death is where life is, if you remove passion towards life, there is no
basis for death to apply to you any longer.

**Q:** ​The sutta continues:

> \"​3-\...When a Bhikkhu becomes accustomed to the perception of the
> other side(patikula) of food/eating, their mind draws back from
> craving for taste, and either upekkha or the other side gets
> established​...\"

**Nm:**​ Your ignorant default mode is that you prioritize the pleasure
of eating. That\'s what you put first. So even when you\'re starving,
losing the sight of that as the reason for your eating, you will be
automatically eating out of pleasure for the taste, not because of the
need for food.

The \'other side\' of the eating is that it\'s \'something you have to
do\'. It\'s a necessity. But by taking that necessity for granted, by
covering it up as a necessity, you then get picky, you start
preferencing tastes and start acting out of tastes. But it doesn\'t
matter how much you act out of taste, it\'s still within the necessity.
You still need to eat. That\'s the horrible thing.

The pressure of eating is there, but you ignore that because you take
food for granted and then on account of it you develop the priority of
tastes, the priority of pleasure. Which is fully within that necessity.
So all you need to do is uncover the fundamental need so that you see it
as that which comes first and tastes as second, not the other way
around. By covering up that need, that pressure, that hunger, that
unpleasantness of being subjected to it, you put joy for the taste
first, you put pleasure first. If you don\'t ignore the fact that food
is a necessity that you\'re presently subjected to, whether you\'re
starving or not, you will then not lose the context of why you need to
eat. No matter how agreeable or disagreeable the eating is, it\'s still
within the unpleasant fact of hunger. So when the hunger disappears, you
stop eating.

**Q:** ​In the Dhammapada verse 203:

> \"​Hunger is the foremost illness; Determinations are the foremost
> dis-ease. For one knowing this, as it really is; Nibbana is the
> foremost ease​\"

**Nm:**​ Hunger is an affliction and your way of dealing with the
affliction is not freeing yourself from being liable to affliction
altogether but in just finding the pleasurable aspects of affliction. So
you\'re not dealing with it, you\'re just managing it, covering it up.

**Q:**​ So that enjoyment of taste, cooking, recipes etc, comes out of
putting that pleasure first and putting that \'other side\', that
necessity of food second.

**Nm:** ​It\'ll be impossible to make the effort towards taste if you
are dispassionate towards taste on account of seeing the necessity
first. That doesn\'t mean that you will not taste if something\'s
agreeable, it just means that it would be impossible for any amount of
agreeable or disagreeable taste to disturb your mind or to pervert the
right order again, by putting first which is second and putting second
which is first.

Taste is always second to hunger, but for you, the taste is the first,
craving is the first, everything else is second, you even forget that
you eat out of hunger. Which is why people eat when they\'re not hungry
because the pleasure of taste is now the criteria. Doesn\'t matter how
refined the criteria you might have developed, it\'s still within the
need of hunger. If there\'s no need for food, you wouldn\'t be engaging
with food.
