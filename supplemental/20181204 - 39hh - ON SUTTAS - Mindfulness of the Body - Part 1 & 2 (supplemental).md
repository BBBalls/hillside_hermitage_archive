Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, gone to the forest, or gone to the root of a tree, or gone to an empty hut sits down, having crossed his legs, with the intention of a straight back, having set up mindfulness in front. Quite mindfully he breathes in, quite mindfully he breathes out. Breathing in long, he understands, ‘I am breathing in long'. Breathing out long, he understands, ‘I am breathing out long'. Breathing in short, he understands, ‘I am breathing in short’. Breathing out short, he understands, ‘I am breathing out short’. He trains thus: ‘I will breathe in experiencing the whole body'. He trains thus: ‘I will breathe out experiencing the whole body'. He trains thus: ‘I will breathe in calming the bodily determinations'. He trains thus: ‘I will breathe out calming the bodily determinations'. For one dwelling in this way, vigilant, ardent, resolute, any memories-&-thoughts connected with home are abandoned. With the abandoning of these internally, the mind stands still, settles down, is unified, is composed. In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the body.|

abandoning of pleasure... dwells having entered
upon the fourth jhana. He is sitting down having
pervaded this very body with a clarified,
purified mind; for him there isn’t anything in
the entire body which hasn’t been pervaded
with a clarified, purified mind. Imagine,
bhikkhus, a man who has dressed himself up to
