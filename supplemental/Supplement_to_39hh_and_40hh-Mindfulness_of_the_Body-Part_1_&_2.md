## Mindfulness of the body

### Supplement to 39hh and 40hh - Mindfulness of the Body - Part 1 & 2

***

### 1. DN 34

“Which one thing should be developed?
Mindfulness of the body endowed with
pleasure. This one thing should be developed.

### 2. MN 119

And, bhikkhus, developed in what way, made
much of in what way, is mindfulness of the body
of much fruit, of much benefit? Here, bhikkhus,
a bhikkhu, gone to the forest, or gone to the
root of a tree, or gone to an empty hut sits
down, having crossed his legs, with the
intention of a straight back, having set up
mindfulness in front. Quite mindfully he
breathes in, quite mindfully he breathes out.
Breathing in long, he understands, ‘I am
breathing in long'. Breathing out long, he
understands, ‘I am breathing out long'.
Breathing in short, he understands, ‘I am
breathing in short’. Breathing out short, he
understands, ‘I am breathing out short’. He
trains thus: ‘I will breathe in experiencing the
whole body'. He trains thus: ‘I will breathe out
experiencing the whole body'. He trains thus: ‘I
will breathe in calming the bodily
determinations'. He trains thus: ‘I will breathe
out calming the bodily determinations'. For one
dwelling in this way, vigilant, ardent, resolute,
any memories-&-thoughts connected with
home are abandoned. With the abandoning of
these internally, the mind stands still, settles
down, is unified, is composed. In this way,
bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of
the body.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu walking,
understands: ‘I am walking'; or standing, he
understands: ‘I am standing'; or sitting down,
he understands: ‘I am sitting down'; or lying
down, he understands: ‘I am lying down'. Or in
whatever way his body is disposed, he
understands this. For one dwelling in this way,
vigilant, ardent, resolute, any memories-&-
thoughts connected with home are abandoned.
With the abandoning of these internally, the
mind stands still, settles down, is unified, is
composed. In this way, too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu
develops mindfulness of the body.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu going
forward, going back, is one who acts with
awareness; looking forward, looking back, he is
one who acts with awareness; bending,
stretching, he is one who acts with awareness;
taking his saṅghāṭi, bowl and robe, he is one
who acts with awareness; eating, drinking,
consuming, tasting, he is one who acts with
awareness; walking, standing, sitting down,
sleeping, waking, speaking, being silent, he is
one who acts with awareness. For one dwelling
in this way, vigilant, ardent, resolute, any
memories-&-thoughts connected with home are
abandoned. With the abandoning of these
internally, the mind stands still, settles down, is
unified, is composed. In this way, too, bhikkhus,
a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the body.

Attending to the repulsive...

Attending to the elements...

The nine cemetery contemplations...

155\. Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, quite
secluded from sense-desires... dwells having
entered upon the first jhana. He makes this very
body flow with joy-&-pleasure born of
seclusion, he makes it flow all around, he fills it
up, he fully pervades it, so that for him there
isn’t anything in the entire body which hasn’t
been pervaded with joy-&-pleasure born of
seclusion. Suppose a skilled barber or a
barber's apprentice, having scattered soap-
powder on a metal dish, having sprinkled
gradually with water, would knead it, for him
this lump of soap is given over to the moisture,
is overcome with the moisture, pervaded
inside-&-out with moisture, but not dripping. In
just this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu makes this very body flow with joy-&-pleasure born of
seclusion, he makes it flow all around, he fills it
up, he fully pervades it, so that for him there
isn’t anything in the entire body which hasn’t
been pervaded with joy-&-pleasure born of
seclusion. For one dwelling in this way,
vigilant... In this way, too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu
develops mindfulness of the body.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, with the
stilling of thinking-&-pondering... dwells having
entered upon the second jhana. He makes this
very body flow with joy-&-pleasure born of
composure, he makes it flow all around, he fills
it up, he fully pervades it, so that for him there
isn’t anything in the entire body which hasn’t
been pervaded with joy-&-pleasure born of
composure. Imagine a deep lake whose waters
well up. There isn’t an inflow for it from the
eastern direction, there isn’t an inflow from the
western direction, there isn’t an inflow from the
northern direction, there isn’t an inflow from
the southern direction, and the sky would not
provide a seasonable shower from time to time.
Then cool torrents of water, having sprung up
from the lake, would make the lake flow with
cool water, would make it flow all around,
would fill it up, would fully pervade it, so that
there wouldn't be anything in the entire lake
that wasn't pervaded with cool water. In just
this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu makes this very
body flow with joy-&-pleasure born of
composure, he makes it flow all around, he fills
it up, he fully pervades it, so that for him there
isn’t anything in the entire body which hasn’t
been pervaded with joy-&-pleasure born of
composure. For one dwelling in this way,
vigilant... In this way, too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu
develops mindfulness of the body.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, with the
fading of joy... dwells having entered upon the
third jhana. He makes this very body flow with
pleasure free from joy, he makes it flow all
around, he fills it up, he fully pervades it, so that
for him there isn’t anything in the entire body
which hasn’t been pervaded with pleasure free
from joy. Imagine, bhikkhus, a pond of
waterlillies, or a pond of lotuses, or a pond of
white lotuses, and some of the waterlillies or
lotuses or white lotuses were born in the water,
grew up in the water, rose up in the water, were
nourished submerged in the water. And insofar
as the roots are flowing, are flowing all around,
are filled up, are fully pervaded with cool water,
there isn’t anything in the entire waterlillies or
lotuses or white lotuses which wasn’t pervaded
with cool water. In just this way, bhikkhus, a
bhikkhu makes this very body flow with
pleasure free from joy, he makes it flow all
around, he fills it up, he fully pervades it, so that
for him there isn’t anything in the entire body
which hasn’t been pervaded with pleasure free
from joy. For one dwelling in this way, vigilant...
In this way, too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops
mindfulness of the body.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, with the
abandoning of pleasure... dwells having entered
upon the fourth jhana. He is sitting down having
pervaded this very body with a clarified,
purified mind; for him there isn’t anything in
the entire body which hasn’t been pervaded
with a clarified, purified mind. Imagine,
bhikkhus, a man who has dressed himself up to
the head in a white cloth were sitting down. In
just this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is sitting
down having pervaded this very body with a
clarified, purified mind; for him there isn’t
anything in the entire body which hasn’t been
pervaded with a clarified, purified mind. For
one dwelling in this way, vigilant, ardent,
resolute, any memories-&-thoughts connected
with home are abandoned. With the
abandoning of these internally, the mind stands
still, settles down, is unified, is composed. In
this way, too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops
mindfulness of the body.

156\. Bhikkhus, for whoever mindfulness of the body
is developed, made much of, whatever
wholesome phenomena included in this are
conducive to wisdom. Imagine, bhikkhus, for
whichever great ocean is pervaded by the mind,
whatever small rivers included in this go into
the great ocean. In just this way, bhikkhus, for
whoever mindfulness of the body is developed,
made much of, whatever wholesome
phenomena included in this are conducive to
wisdom.

Bhikkhus, for whoever mindfulness of the body
is not developed, not made much of, Māra gains
access to him, Māra gains a foundation in him.
Suppose, bhikkhus, a man were to throw a
heavy stone into a damp pile of clay. What do
you think, bhikkhus? Would that heavy stone
gain access into that damp pile of clay?” “Yes, Bhante.” “In just this way, bhikkhus, for
whoever mindfulness of the body is not
developed, not made much of, Māra gains
access to him, Māra gains a foundation in him.
Imagine, bhikkhus, some dry sapless wood.
Then a man would come to get some kindling
—“I will produce a fire, I will manifest fire.”
What do you think, bhikkhus? Having taken a
bit of dry sapless wood, rubbing it, would this
man produce a fire, manifest fire?” “Yes,
Bhante.” “In just this way, bhikkhus, for
whoever mindfulness of the body is not
developed, not made much of, Māra gains
access to him, Māra gains a foundation in him.
Imagine, bhikkhus, a hollow empty water-jug
placed in a basin. Then a man would come to
take a load of water. What do you think,
bhikkhus, would this man manage to get rid of
the water?” “Yes, Bhante.” “In just this way,
bhikkhus, for whoever mindfulness of the body
is not developed, not made much of, Māra gains
access to him, Māra gains a foundation in him.”

157\. Bhikkhus, for whoever mindfulness of the body
is developed, made much of, Māra does not gain
access to him, Māra does not gain a foundation
in him. Suppose, bhikkhus, a man were to throw
a light ball of string at a door-panel made
entirely of hard wood. What do you think,
bhikkhus? Would that light ball of string gain
access into that door-panel made entirely of
hard wood?” “No, Bhante.” “In just this way,
bhikkhus, for whoever mindfulness of the body
is developed, made much of, Māra does not gain
access to him, Māra does not gain a foundation
in him. Imagine, bhikkhus, some damp sappy
wood. Then a man would come to get some
kindling—“I will produce a fire, I will manifest
fire.” What do you think, bhikkhus? Having
taken a bit of damp sappy wood, rubbing it,
would this man produce a fire, manifest fire?”
“No, Bhante.” “In just this way, bhikkhus, for
whoever mindfulness of the body is developed,
made much of, Māra does not gain access to
him, Māra does not gain a foundation in him.
Imagine, bhikkhus, a water-jug placed in a
basin, full to the brim with water, which crows
could drink. Then a man would come to take a
load of water. What do you think, bhikkhus,
would this man manage to get rid of the water?”
“No, Bhante.” “In just this way, bhikkhus, for
whoever mindfulness of the body is developed,
made much of, Māra does not gain access to
him, Māra does not gain a foundation in him.

158\. Bhikkhus, for whoever mindfulness of the body
is developed, made much of, wherever he
directs the mind to the realisation by
discernment of things that can be realised by
discernment—right there, if there is an
opening, he attains the ability to witness it for
himself. Imagine, bhikkhus, a water-jug placed
in a basin, full to the brim with water, which
crows could drink. Whenever a strong man
would draw water, would water come?” “Yes,
Bhante”. “In just this way, bhikkhus, for
whoever mindfulness of the body is developed,
made much of, wherever he directs the mind to
the realisation by discernment of things that
can be realised by discernment—right there, if
there is an opening, he attains the ability to
witness it for himself. Imagine, bhikkhus, that a
square pond on a level piece of land, trapped by
a dam, full to the brim with water, which crows
could drink. Whenever a strong man would
release the dam, would the water come?” “Yes,
Bhante”. “In just this way, bhikkhus, for
whoever mindfulness of the body is developed,
made much of, wherever he directs the mind to
the realisation by discernment of things that
can be realised by discernment—right there, if
there is an opening, he attains the ability to
witness it for himself. Imagine, bhikkhus, a
chariot on even ground at a crossroads,
harnessed to thoroughbreds, standing with its
goad fallen down. A skilled charioteer, horse-
trainer, having mounted, having taken the reins
with his left hand, having taken the goad with
his right hand, would make it move, make it go
wherever he wished. In just this way, bhikkhus,
for whoever mindfulness of the body is
developed, made much of, wherever he directs
the mind to the realisation by discernment of
things that can be realised by discernment—
right there, if there is an opening, he attains the
ability to witness it for himself.”

159\. “Bhikkhus, with mindfulness of the body
frequently developed, made much of, made a
habit of, made a basis of, practised, made
familiar, thoroughly undertaken, ten benefits
are to be expected.

(i) There is enduring non-delight-&-delight but he does not endure this non-delight, he dwells
having overcome arisen non-delight.

(ii) There is enduring fear-&-dread, but he does
not endure this fear-&-dread, he dwells having
overcome arisen fear-&-dread.

(iii) There is patience towards cold, heat,
hunger, thirst, contact-with-flies-mosquitoes-
wind-heat-&-creepie-crawlies; there is
endurance towards bad speech, unwelcome
ways of speaking, arisen feelings in the body
that are painful, sharp, rough, severe,
disagreeable, displeasing, taking away life.

(iv) He is one who obtains at will, without
trouble, without difficulty, the four jhanas, of
the higher mind, pleasant dwellings here-&-
now.

(v) He experiences the various kinds of powers.
Having been one, he is many; having been many
he is one... he exerts control with his body as far
as the Brahma world.

(vi) With the divine ear-element, which is
clarified and surmounts the human, he hears
sounds both divine and human, whether far or
near...

(vii) He understands the minds of other beings,
of other individuals, having encompassed them
by mind. He understands a mind with passion
as: ‘A mind with passion’; or he understands a
mind free from passion... a mind with ill-will... a
mind free from ill-will... a mind with delusion...
a mind free from delusion... a contracted mind...
a scattered mind... an enlarged mind... an
unenlarged mind... an mind with something
beyond... a mind without anything beyond... a
composed mind... an uncomposed mind... a
liberated mind... he understands an unliberated
mind as: ‘An unliberated mind’.

(viii) He recollects various former lives, that is...
one birth, two births... with such a reason, with
such an explanation, he recollects various kinds
of former lives.

(ix) With the divine eye-element, which is
clarified and surmounts the human, he sees
beings passing away, reappearing, inferior,
excellent, beautiful, ugly, good destinations, bad
destinations, he understands that beings go
according to their actions.

(x) Having realised for himself by recognising
here-&-now liberation of mind, liberation of
understanding, he dwells having entered upon
the destruction of the outflows which is without
outflows.

Bhikkhus, with mindfulness of the body
frequently developed, made much of, made a
habit of, made a basis of, practised, made
familiar, thoroughly undertaken, these ten
benefits are to be expected.”

### 4. SN 35:247

247\. Suppose, bhikkhus, a man with wounds on his
body, with a festering body, would go into a
wood of reeds and the kusa-thorns would
pierce his feet, the leaves of the reeds would
scratch his limbs. Thus, bhikkhus, on account of
this, that man would experience a huge amount
of pain and unhappiness. In just this way,
bhikkhus, here a certain bhikkhu, who has
gone to a village or gone to a forest, meets
someone who says: “This venerable one is
someone who acts like this, who behaves like
this, a filthy thorn of the village.” Having seen
thus, restraint and non-restraint should be
seen.

And which, bhikkhus, is non-restraint? Here,
bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, having seen a sight with
the eye, inclines towards a pleasing sight, he is
troubled by a displeasing sight, and he dwells
without mindfulness of the body set up, with a
limited mind. And he does not understand as it
really is that liberation of mind, liberation of
understanding, where those arisen evil
unwholesome things cease for him without
remainder. Having heard a sound with the ear...
Having smelled a smell with the nose... Having
tasted a taste with the tongue... Having touched
a touch with the body... Having imagined a
phenomenon with the mind, he inclines
towards a pleasing phenomenon, he is troubled
by a displeasing phenomenon, and he dwells
without mindfulness of the body set up, with a
limited mind. And he does not understand as it
really is that liberation of mind, liberation of
understanding, where those arisen evil
unwholesome things cease for him without
remainder.

Suppose, bhikkhus, a man, having taken hold of
six animals, with different domains, different
feeding grounds, would tie them up with a
strong rope. Having taken hold of a snake, he
would tie it up with a strong rope. Having
taken hold of a crocodile, he would tie it up
with a strong rope. Having taken hold of a bird,
he would tie it up with a strong rope. Having
taken hold of a dog, he would tie it up with a
strong rope. Having taken hold of a jackal, he
would tie it up with a strong rope. Having
taken hold of a monkey, he would tie it up with
a strong rope. Having tied them up with a
strong rope, having made a knot in the middle,
he would release them. Then, bhikkhus, those
six animals, with different domains, different
feeding grounds, would each pull towards its
own feeding-ground-&-domain—the snake
would pull: ‘I will enter an ant-hill.’ The
crocodile would pull: ‘I will enter the water.’
The bird would pull: ‘I will fly up into the sky.’
The dog would pull: ‘I will enter the village.’
The jackal would pull: ‘I will enter the
graveyard.’ The monkey would pull: ‘I will
enter the woods.’ Bhikkhus, when those six
animals would be worn out, exhausted, then
whichever is the strongest out of the animals—
they would submit to it, they would follow it,
they would come under its control. In just this
way, bhikkhus, for whatever bhikkhu
mindfulness of the body is not developed, not
made much of, the eye pulls into agreeable
sights, disagreeable sights are repulsive... The
mind pulls into agreeable phenomena,
disagreeable phenomena are repulsive. In this
way, bhikkhus, one is unrestrained.

And which, bhikkhus, is restraint? Here,
bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, having seen a sight with
the eye, does not incline towards a pleasing
sight, is not troubled by a displeasing sight, and
he dwells with mindfulness of the body set up,
with an immeasurable mind. And he
understands as it really is that liberation of
mind, liberation of understanding, where those
arisen evil unwholesome things cease for him
without remainder. Having heard a sound with
the ear... Having smelled a smell with the nose...
Having tasted a taste with the tongue... Having
touched a touch with the body... Having
imagined a phenomenon with the mind, he
does not incline towards a pleasing
phenomenon, he is not troubled by a
displeasing phenomenon, and he dwells with
mindfulness of the body set up, with an
immeasurable mind. And he understands as it
really is that liberation of mind, liberation of
understanding, where those arisen evil
unwholesome things cease for him without
remainder.

Suppose, bhikkhus, a man, having taken hold of
six animals, with different domains, different
feeding grounds, would tie them up with a
strong rope. Having taken hold of a snake, he
would tie it up with a strong rope. Having
taken hold of a crocodile, he would tie it up
with a strong rope. Having taken hold of a
bird... Having taken hold of a dog... Having
taken hold of a jackal... Having taken hold of a
monkey, he would tie it up with a strong rope.
Having tied them up with a strong rope, he
would tie them on to a strong stake or post.
Then, bhikkhus, those six animals, with
different domains, different feeding grounds,
would each pull towards its own feeding-
ground-&-domain—the snake would pull: ‘I
will enter an ant-hill.’ The crocodile would pull:
‘I will enter the water.’ The bird would pull: ‘I
will fly up into the sky.’ The dog would pull: ‘I
will enter the village.’ The jackal would pull: ‘I
will enter the graveyard.’ The monkey would
pull: ‘I will enter the woods.’ Bhikkhus, when
those six animals would be worn out,
exhausted, then they would stand next to, they
would sit down next to, they would lie down
next to that strong stake or post. In just this
way, bhikkhus, for whatever bhikkhu
mindfulness of the body is developed, made
much of, the eye does not pull into agreeable
sights, disagreeable sights are not repulsive...
The mind does not pull into agreeable
phenomena, disagreeable phenomena are not
repulsive. In this way, bhikkhus, one is
restrained.

‘A strong stake or post’—this, bhikkhus, is a
designation for mindfulness of the body.
Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train in this
way: ‘Mindfulness of the body will be
developed by us, made much of, made our
vehicle, made our ground, carried out,
practised, properly undertaken.’ In this way,
bhikkhus, you should train.

### 5. SN 43:1 & 43:44

1\. At Sāvatthi. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you the
undetermined and the path leading to the
undetermined. Listen to this. And which,
bhikkhus, is the undetermined? Bhikkhus,
whatever destruction of passion, destruction of
ill-will, destruction of delusion—this, bhikkhus,
is called the undetermined. And which,
bhikkhus, is called the path leading to the
undetermined? Mindfulness of the body. This,
bhikkhus, is called the path leading to the
undetermined.

Thus, bhikkhus, the undetermined has been
taught, the path leading to the undetermined
has been taught by me to you. Bhikkhus,
whatever should be done by a teacher who
seeks the welfare of the students, with
compassion, out of compassion—this has been
done by you for you. Bhikkhus, these are roots
of trees, these are empty huts. Meditate,
bhikkhus, do not be negligent. Don't be
regretful later. This is our instruction to you.

44\. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you the goal and the
path leading to the goal. Listen to this. And
which, bhikkhus, is the goal? Bhikkhus,
whatever destruction of passion, destruction of
ill-will, destruction of delusion—this, bhikkhus,
is called the goal. And which, bhikkhus, is
called the path leading to the goal? Mindfulness
of the body. This, bhikkhus, is called the path
leading to the goal.

Thus, bhikkhus, the undetermined has been
taught, the path leading to the undetermined
has been taught by me to you. Bhikkhus,
whatever should be done by a teacher who
seeks the welfare of the students, with
compassion, out of compassion—this has been
done by you for you. Bhikkhus, these are roots
of trees, these are empty huts. Meditate,
bhikkhus, do not be negligent. Don't be
regretful later. This is our instruction to you.

### 6. SN 47:20

386\. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed
One was living among the Sumbhans, in a town
of the Sumbhans called Sedaka. There, the
Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:
“Bhikkhus.” “Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus
replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One
said this:

“Bhikkhus, imagine: ‘The most beautiful girl in
the country, the most beautiful girl in the
country’—a big crowd of people would gather.
And this most beautiful girl in the country is a
performer of the finest dancing, a performer of
the finest singing. Bhikkhus, ‘The most
beautiful girl in the country is dancing, the
most beautiful girl in the country is singing’—
an even bigger crowd of people would gather.
Then a man would come who desires life, who
does not desire death, who desires pleasure,
who is repelled by pain. Then someone would
say thus: ‘This, my good man, is a bowl of oil
filled to the brim must be carried between the
festive gathering and the most beautiful girl in
the country. And a man, with a drawn sword,
will follow right behind you. Wherever you
spill even a tiny amount, right there he will
chop off your head.’ What do you think,
bhikkhus, would that man, not attending
outwardly to that bowl of oil, fall back into
negligence?” “No, Bhante.”

“Bhikkhus, the simile was made by me to
convey a meaning. And just this is the meaning
here: ‘The bowl of oil filled to the brim’—this,
bhikkhus, is a designation for mindfulness of
the body. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train
thus: ‘Mindfulness of the body will be
developed by us, made much of, made our
vehicle, made our ground, carried out,
practised, properly undertaken.’ In this way,
bhikkhus, you should train.’”

### 7. Dhp XI: 10 (v.299)

299\. Properly awakened, the disciples of Gotama
are always awake,
For whover day and night mindfulness of the
body is constant.

### 8. Ud 3:5; 7:8

25\. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the
Blessed One was living in Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s
Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now on that
occasion the venerable Mahāmoggallāna was
sitting down not far from the Blessed One,
having folded his legs crosswise, trying to keep
a straight back, having properly set up
mindfulness of the body internally. The
Blessed One saw that the venerable
Mahāmoggallāna was sitting down not far
away, having folded his legs crosswise, trying
to keep a straight back, having properly set up
mindfulness of the body internally.

Then the Blessed One, having understood the
meaning of this, on this occasion, uttered this
utterance:

“With mindfulness of the body established,
Restrained in the six domains of contact,
A bhikkhu who is constantly composed,
Would understand the extinguishing of
himself.”

68\. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the
Blessed One was living in Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s
Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now on that
occasion the venerable Mahākaccāna was
sitting down not far from the Blessed One,
having folded his legs crosswise, trying to keep
a straight back, having properly set up
mindfulness of the body internally. The
Blessed One saw that the venerable
Mahākaccāna was sitting down not far away,
having folded his legs crosswise, trying to keep
a straight back, having properly set up
mindfulness of the body internally.

Then the Blessed One, having understood the
meaning of this, on this occasion, uttered this
utterance:

“For whoever mindfulness of the body
is always continuously established
It could not be, it could not be mine,
It will not be, it will not be mine.
One who gradually dwells in that place
at the right time passes over attachment.”

### 9. Sn 2:11

342\. Be restrained in the Pātimokkha and in the
five faculties,
Be mindful of the body, full of disgust for
existence.

### 10. Th 6; 636; 1038; 1234

6\. “The bhikkhu who has reached the cool woods,
alone, contented, self-composed.
Is victorious, free from excitement, guarding
mindfulness of the body, resolute.

636\. But for whoever has properly undertaken
constant mindfulness of the body,
They do not practise what shouldn’t be done,
they are one who continuously do what should
be done.
With mindfulness, with awareness, they come
to the meaning of the taints.

1038\. For one whose friends have passed away, for
one whose Teacher has gone away,
There is no friend quite like mindfulness of the
body.

1234\. Develop a mind of the unpleasant, unified,
properly composed.
Be mindful of the body, full of disgust for
existence.
