an essay

by **Bhikkhu Anīgha**



It’s common knowledge that the literal meaning of “*yoni*” in “*yoniso
manasikāra*” is “womb; origin; source”. However, the Buddha’s clearly
nonaccidental use of the term is rarely thought to be of deep
significance or to convey crucial nuances. Moreover, it seems
translators almost always choose to disregard the literal meaning of
*yoni* altogether and instead trivialize *yoniso manasikāra* by
rendering it as “appropriate/careful/proper/thorough/prudent attention”.
If the Buddha truly intended to denote something this mundane, he could
easily have employed an expression like “*sādhuka-manasikāra*” or
“*sakkacca-manasikāra*”, instead of using such an unnecessarily obscure
adverb like “*yoniso*”. What’s more, the expression “*sādhukaṁ yoniso
manasikaroti*” occurs in several Suttas (e.g. SN 12.37), which itself
suggests that *yoniso* means something other than just “appropriately,
properly, etc.” Such renderings also water down what is undeniably an
utterly central factor of the practice, effectively saying that by not
being scatterbrained and by hearing the Dhamma, one possesses what is
necessary to become a stream-enterer and thus acquire the Noble
Eightfold Path:

> “Bhikkhus, there are these two conditions for the arising of the Right
> View. What two? The utterance of another and ‘yoniso manasikāra’.
> These are the two conditions for the arising of the Right View.”

This is a tragic oversimplification. “Appropriate attention” does not
tell us anything because, by definition, every unenlightened
practitioner takes their attention to be already “appropriate” when in
fact it’s not so[^1], and by not questioning that way of attending, they
would not make the effort to understand what *yoniso manasikāra* is,
which is by itself the first stage of enlightenment:
knowledge-and-vision of the way leading to the cessation of suffering.

Fortunately, however, it is possible to come closer to what the Buddha
meant with the term in a way that is consistent with its etymology and
all its occurrences in the texts, and most importantly, tells us how and
why it is the *one thing* responsible for the arising of those states
conducive to freedom from suffering, and how we can practically go about
developing it.

The first and most relevant distinction to make is that, based on the
Pāli alone, *yoniso* means “*in terms of* the origin/womb” or “*by way
of* the origin/womb”. It could even be taken as “*from* the
origin/womb”. There is therefore not even a grammatical justification
for taking *yoniso manasikāra* to mean attention **to** something, and
there are very good reasons for this on the grounds of Dhamma as well.
It’s not only a matter of scholastic accuracy. If we investigate the
general trend of what is presented as *yoniso manasikāra* in
contemporary Buddhist discourse, it is evidently telling us to attend
**to** something. To simply choose one *object* instead of another, with
even the most nuanced mental reflections being objects just the same,
pertaining to the sixth sense base. As it will be shown, this only
serves to temporarily suppress the symptoms of the disease of being
*liable* to suffering, and ultimately fails to tackle the root cause.

(***From here onwards, text is underlined when it helps to illustrate
the principle of yoniso manasikāra, with single underlining denoting the
domain of direct <u>attention</u>, and double underlining that which is
more fundamental than it, the <du>yoni</du>***)

The discernment that truly *uproots* the ownership of our whole
experience[^2] is that of the *paṭiccasamuppāda* principle: “with this,
this is; without this, this is not”[^3]. One has to see the present
experience in its fullness, anything that *is* or *could* be attended
to, leaving nothing out, as one thing, as “<u>**this**</u>”. That
“<u>**this**</u>” will inevitably be the place where one’s sense of self
and ownership is established, and includes **all** of one’s present
feelings, perceptions, thoughts, and intentions to do this or that.
“<u>**This**</u>” is the five aggregates in their entirety —“past,
present or future, internal or external, coarse or fine, lowly or
sublime, far or near”.[^4]

The goal is then to see that whole “<u>**this**</u>”, which is, again,
one’s entire world, not just one thing, as *within*, as being fully
dependent on, secondary to, simultaneously **originated from**
(*paṭiccasamuppanna*) another “<du>**this**</du>”. This will
automatically prevent you from assuming **yourself** as the origin, the
owner, the master of this experience—of this
<u>**attention**/***manasikāra***</u>. It will truly prevent assuming as
yours *anything* that you can attend to, as opposed to fruitlessly
denying that *this* or *that* is yours… using the same
<u>**attention**</u> that you still take as yours. This is because the
assumption of “mine” is not a matter of choice, it’s a matter of simply
not being presently aware of something more fundamental than your own
attention, which causes the “I” to become that fundamental thing
automatically. Awareness of this <du>**more fundamental
phenomenon**</du> is the *yoniso* aspect in <du>***yoniso***</du>
<u>***manasikāra***</u>.

> “Bhikkhus, do you see: ‘<u>**This**</u> is’?”—“Yes, venerable
> sir.”—“Bhikkhus, do you see: ‘<u>**It**</u> exists with <du>**this
> nutriment**</du>’?”—“Yes, venerable sir.”—“Bhikkhus, do you see: ‘With
> the cessation of <du>**this nutriment**</du>, <u>**that which is**</u>
> is subject to cessation’?”—“Yes, venerable sir.”
>
> — <cite>MN 38</cite>

Failing to correctly see that “<du>**nutriment**</du>” as that which is
more structurally fundamental than “<u>**this**</u>” ( the experience as
a whole) is *ayoniso manasikāra*, and it is what maintains the deepest
unwholesome, the fetter of self-view/*sakkāyadiṭṭhi* (cf. <cite>AN
1.66</cite> above), *regardless* of how much one tries to tell oneself
that things are “not mine”. In other words, *a-yoniso manasikāra* is not
some specific mistake you are doing or thinking—it is the **absence**
altogether of the awareness of that *yoni* <du>**on the right
level**</du>. This is also why in MN 2 it is said that the *puthujjana*
lacks even the correct understanding of what *yoniso manasikāra* is—
*ayoniso manasikāra* is the very reason for his self-view. Self-view
cannot possibly remain once *yoniso manasikāra*
(i.e. *paṭiccasamuppāda*) is correctly understood.

*Paṭiccasamuppāda* is in fact said by the Buddha to be the “noble
method”[^5] (namely, for the uprooting of craving and appropriation).
It’s not, contrary to popular belief, an esoteric insight that comes out
of a “meditation experience”. It *is* what meditation (i.e. *yoniso
manasikāra*) is. This is why correct meditation is not possible unless a
person has the Right View and is accomplished in seeing
*paṭiccasamuppāda*/*yoniso manasikāra*.[^6] Before that, the effort is
to *learn* what *yoniso manasikāra* is, and keep taking one’s present
understanding of it with a pinch of salt.

It is also the discernment of yoniso manasikāra that caused Ven.
Sāriputta to enter the stream upon grasping the meaning of the
well-known verse:

> Whatever <u>***things are dependently arisen***</u>—  
> <du>***That which they depend on***</du> has been told by the
> Tathāgata  
> As well as the cessation of those things,  
> Such speaks the great ascetic.
>
> — <cite>Mahāvagga 1.23</cite>

*Yoniso manasikāra* is not about <u>***what***</u> your attention is
directed at, it’s about discerning the <du>***container***</du> (yoni,
the “womb”) that your <u>**attention**</u> depends on, as the verse
says. Only then can one abandon the ownership of attention itself.
Nothing less than this can contribute to the cessation of suffering, nor
reveal the path towards it. Merely replacing the <u>**things**</u> one
attends to with other <u>**things**</u>, the “good” <u>**things**</u>,
will not bring the unwholesome to decline and the wholesome to increase.
Whatever is wholesome, being non-greed, non-aversion and non-delusion,
always comes from correctly discerning the <du>**simultaneous
basis**</du> for <u>***whatever*** **your attention is directed**</u>
at, so that you can surmount the *possibility* of lust and aversion,
instead of just abandoning particular *things* that entice you or bother
you, which would evidently be an interminable endeavor.[^7]

For instance, the practices of *asubha* and *mettā* are often
misinterpreted as “replacements” for the attention towards beautiful and
disagreeable people respectively. But this teaches us nothing whatsoever
about our appropriation of *attention itself*, which is where the true
lust, aversion and delusion find their footing. The appropriation of
attention induced by lack of *yoniso manasikāra* **is** what lust,
aversion and delusion are, based on whether the attention is directed at
pleasure, pain, or neutral feeling respectively. And this is,
ironically, what this manner of practice increases further: the tendency
to be fully identified with one’s attention (*ayoniso manasikāra*), just
now involving a different object— often mistakenly taking that to be the
fulfillment of the Dhamma to boot, simply because it offers a seemingly
special sort of peace—a sort which is clearly temporary, just like
managing the symptoms and not the cause of an illness.[^8]

Now, the question arises: what exactly is that <du>**broader
phenomenon**</du> that one must discern *in regard* to one’s
<u>**attention**</u>, so that <u>***attention itself***</u> will be seen
as “not mine” even if I *wanted* it to be mine, rather than just
*telling* myself that it’s “not mine”… with <u>**another attention**</u>
that I still take as mine? This is where the <du>**four
satipaṭṭhānas**</du> come in, or really any correct way of regarding our
<u>**experience**</u> found in the Suttas.

The four satipaṭṭhānas are four general aspects that can be
interchangeably discerned as the “womb” (yoni) or “container” of this
experience as a whole, so that I can no longer assume that experience as
within ***me***. The most practical example would be in terms of the
body.

If I just try to discern it, it is evident that anything I have attended
to, am attending to, or will be attending to, has this body, this lump
of flesh as its fundamental container. Even me now attending to the idea
of “this body is the container” has this body as its container. Any
pleasure or pain that I might experience, and try get more of, get less
off, accept, deny, deal with, is enclosed by the “womb” which is this
body.[^9] And, quite importantly, whatever *views* I may have about
anything at all whatsoever, even the “correct” views I could have
acquired face-to-face with the Buddha himself—I can *attend* to them
only because this body is still there. This body is the simultaneous
“<du>**nutriment**</du>” for my <u>**entire world**</u>, and without
that nutriment, that world cannot remain.

>
> — <cite>SN 36.7</cite>

But one can also alternatively take the *most general* present feeling
as the “womb” of one’s attention, whether it’s overall “pleasant”,
“unpleasant” or “neither”. One’s whole world of the five
aggregates—matter, more specific feelings, perceptions, intentions or
consciousness— is enclosed within the “womb” of a general pleasantness
being felt right now, for instance. Even if one chooses to think about
the past, e.g., if yesterday there was pain or neither pleasure nor
pain, those thoughts can only be had on the basis of *this feeling* that
is here now. All of one’s actions in the present will also be by
necessity subordinate to that feeling. This means also that whatever
<u>**intentions infused with** ***craving***</u> to get “more” of this
feeling which one might engage with now will be *secondary* to the fact
that this <du>**broader feeling**</du> is there *first*.[^10] One can
certainly go and *try* to get pleasure out of particular objects, but
that pleasure will always remain secondary to the more general feeling
one is presently enclosed in, through which all other “lesser” feelings
are felt.

This is why, as everyone has no doubt experienced first-hand, when there
is a very unpleasant feeling as the “womb”, no amount of agreeable
things one seeks out—nice food, company, distractions—can truly usurp
the throne of that broader pain. Conversely, when a very pleasant
feeling just so happens to be there as the container of everything else,
even meeting with upsetting circumstances does not shake the primacy of
that overall pleasantness. This means that whenever you suddenly find
yourself within a different <du>**overarching feeling**</du>, it’s not
because *you* brought about change through your <u>**actions**</u>. The
fact that your attempts sometimes succeed and sometimes don’t means that
ultimately you are like a subordinate submitting proposals, and the
feeling is the boss having the final say. In truth, it changes on its
own, and you cannot even know “when” exactly that background feeling
became different: trying to figure out “when” will be a thought that is
already totally enclosed within the “new” general feeling you are now
within. You can only pinpoint the changes of specific feelings, which
corresponds to changes in <u>***attention***</u>, not of that
<du>**greater feeling**</du> which precedes the movements of attention.

The same principle extends to the other 2 satipaṭṭhānas. It is
particularly relevant to note in reference to the contemplation of the
mind that the Buddha instructs us to *know* a lustful, averse, or
deluded mind for what it is. That alone would result in “abiding
independent, not clinging to anything in the world”, as the Satipaṭṭhāna
Sutta says. This is because, by knowing that state of mind as the *yoni*
of one’s present attention one will, if doing it correctly, become
incapable of *taking up* that lustful mind and acting out of it.
Therefore, the former lust ceases to be lust, and it simply becomes a
mental state that is clearly known as unownable and arisen on its own,
without needing to act on account of it on any level. In fact, that
mental state was “lustful” and caused suffering solely *because* one was
unwilling to see it as the present “womb”, and instead wanted to break
out of it in one way or another. Seeing it correctly would allow one to
endure it just like heat, cold, and the harsh words of others, and it
would cease to be a problem altogether and to require any kind of
“response”.

*Yoniso manasikāra*, seeing oneself as enclosed within that present
mental state (which could last for days), would also allow one to
recognize that acting out of lust is falling for a deceitful trap—pain
that invites you to regard it as pleasure and seek more of it.[^11]
Whatever pleasure could be sought after will be limited to the
<u>**domain of attention**</u>, which is now seen to be *enclosed* in
the pain of that <du>**oppressive mental state**</du>, and one sees that
seeking <u>**pleasure**</u> to gratify that <du>**mental state**</du>
would be like applying medicine <u>**on the skin**</u> to cure <du>**a
digestive issue**</du>. The result of this is dispassion towards both
the mental state and whatever experiences are secondary to it—and these
two together comprise one’s entire world at any given time, which is now
truly “not clung to”. Note how *none* of this would have been seen if
one had automatically jumped onto other *objects of attention* in the
name of “practice” to wriggle out of the unpleasant pressure as quickly
as possible, thereby dismissing the very basis where insight into the
drawback of lust would take root.

If attention to specific things were what liberates the mind, the Buddha
could have used terms like “kusala-manasikāra” (wholesome/beneficial
attention) or similar, or even “yoni- manasikāra” (attention *to* the
womb), which would make it clear that the *object* of attention is what
makes the difference. But this is not the case. Attention alone will
always be *ayoniso* for an unenlightened mind, and thus it will bring
unwholesome states (i.e., the ownership of attention) to increase or at
least be maintained—even if the attention is directed towards the
“good”, like the four satipaṭṭhānas. If they are attended to as objects
to replace all others, and not discerned as the “*womb*” of the
experience, as the context behind any and all objects whatsoever, they
do not address the root cause of suffering, and they do not constitute
establishments of *sati* to begin with. So, while one may temporarily
suppress states of lust and aversion, and get some temporary peace out
of that, one has not truly addressed ignorance/delusion, and potentially
made it even harder to overcome later by forming attachment to such
quick-fix practices.

The true wholesome is always about *concurrently* knowing the
<du>***yoni***</du> while <u>***manasikāra***</u> is taking place. This
is the only way out. Attention by itself is still within the *All* (it’s
an aspect of *nāma*[^12]), and thus it cannot provide the escape from
<u>***the All***</u>—the escape from <u>***viññāna-nāmarūpa***</u>.[^13]

**A few additional points that emerge from all the above:**

1.  There are several practically useful implications of the imagery of
    “womb” or “container” to describe the nature of what needs to be
    discerned for the right practice:

    - A fetus is completely and utterly dependent upon his mother’s
      womb. It would be plainly ludicrous for it to entertain the notion
      of being the ultimate master of his body, when every little cell
      that he calls “me” or “mine” has been provided and is at this very
      moment kept alive only thanks to his mother’s womb, and he didn’t
      even get to decide the arrangement of it all. To boot, he can’t
      even procure his own food; it’s provided to him by the womb as
      well.

      We have all come out of the womb already, but the situation is
      ultimately the same. Our body, the basis of even our most abstract
      ponderings, is still inseparable from the food we eat, and we
      don’t even have a say on how and *whether* it is nourished by that
      food. It could stop being so any time. Furthermore, all our
      internal life, feelings, memories, desires, hates, habits, are
      there only because the “womb” of the body— which itself has
      physical food as its sustenance and is therefore impermanent per
      se —is there enabling it. Without that body, even that inner life,
      this “being” that we are, however special it may feel, would not
      be.[^14]

    - Another aspect of the fetus in the womb metaphor is that no matter
      how close the fetus may stare at and examine any given particulars
      of the womb it’s within, this alone would never allow it to
      *discern* the situation of “I am enclosed within this”. That takes
      a subtler form of knowing, *peripherally* to what it’s directly
      experiencing— peripheral to his *attention*. What it would see,
      observe, and feel (hypothetically assuming it would open its eyes
      and be able to see) is colors, shapes and bodily sensations, none
      of which reveals the true *significance* of that which his
      attention is directed at and thus allows him to discern the womb
      as his container.

      This is why meditation techniques involving <u>**observation,
      focused attention and concentration**</u> upon *things*, be they
      physical or mental imagery or concepts of any kind, are the
      epitome of *ayoniso manasikāra*, while claiming to be the
      opposite. They entail doubling down even more in the direction of
      the *attention*, the very grasping to which keeps beings bound to
      *saṁsāra*. Just like if the fetus would use a magnifying glass in
      hopes of it revealing to the truth of his enclosure, and thus lose
      even the chance of recognizing the wider context, these practices
      distract one even more from discerning the *yoni* of attention so
      one can finally abandon the mistaken notions of ownership of the
      latter.

      It’s also why <u>**intellectualizing and psychologizing**</u> the
      Dhamma as a means of practice is wrong, because it equally
      involves putting all the weight on the *attention* (in this case
      to thoughts and ideas) and thus overlooking the
      <du>**foundation**</du> of it all, just like when observing bodily
      sensations as a practice. It doesn’t matter *what* those thoughts
      are, even if they are the loftiest Dhamma, verbatim from the
      Buddha’s mouth—the actual Dhamma is always about the discernment
      of the broader context behind your thinking, the womb which your
      attention (“you”) sits in. The root of suffering and agitation is
      therefore never the *thinking*, it’s the fact that it’s being done
      *ayoniso*.

    - The relationship between the fetus and the womb is a simultaneous
      one; it does not involve time. Similarly, the relationship that
      must be discerned between attention as a whole and its yoni is
      timeless. It is simply *paṭiccasamuppāda*, which literally means
      “dependent-manifestation-**together**”, not “one first and the
      other ‘comes to be’ later”, as it’s often translated and
      interpreted.

    - Lastly, just as coming out of the womb is the usual meaning of
      “birth”, failing to see your attention (“yourself”) as enclosed by
      the metaphorical *yoni*, e.g. the body, is what “being” (*bhava*)
      is. This is the only way that one can truly conceive an “I” who is
      the master of the five aggregates—a true “master” cannot be
      enclosed within something else which he cannot control. And if
      there is that *being*, that “I” born of *ayoniso manasikāra*,
      there is birth[^16]: the entire past, present and future of that
      experience, the five aggregates, now belong to that “I” that has
      been conceived outside of the “womb” through *ayoniso manasikāra*.
      Thus, the inevitable deterioration and destruction of those
      aggregates is now the manifold types of suffering and the death
      that this born “I” will undergo.[^17]

      Consequently, if *yoniso manasikāra* is fully developed, it will
      become *impossible* to conceive of an “I” outside of its “womb”,
      hence there will be no birth here-&-now. This fully unshakable
      *yoniso manasikāra* is precisely the destruction of ignorance, and
      it’s also the reason why an Arahant knows with total certainty
      that “birth is destroyed”.[^18]

2.  The practice of sense restraint should also be understood as not
    losing the perspective of the “womb” *while* sense objects present
    themselves. As its common description goes, sense restraint prevents
    unwholesome states from arising, which means it *has* to be about
    *yoniso manasikāra* by definition.[^19] So, on one level, sense
    restraint is a preliminary practice in the sense of simply not
    engaging with certain things that are *always* unwholesome,
    i.e. things outside the boundaries of the precepts.. But if one
    refines sense restraint up to the level of never overlooking the
    “womb” of one’s attention regardless of what it’s directed at, as
    opposed to just an avoidance of specific things, it’s the entire
    practice, culminating in full non-ownership of the senses.

    >
    > — <cite>SN 35.247</cite>

    Note how the man in the simile does **not** try to forcefully *stop*
    the animals from pulling towards their respective domains (as the
    practice of restraint is often carried out), **nor** does he cut
    them any slack and encourage them to keep pulling on the rope.[^20]
    He has simply established the <du>**recollection of the body**</du>
    as the anchor for the <u>**six animals**</u> until they tire out and
    settle down by *themselves*. This connects to the following point:

3.  The Dhamma is timeless and visible here-&-now precisely because it’s
    solely about discerning that yoni that is already there and always
    has been. “Management”, the opposite of the Dhamma, is whatever you
    do by controlling the attention itself, and that takes time, and its
    result is only visible later, if at all. Because of this, it always
    involves anticipation and expectation of a future result,
    i.e. craving. It’s also why the correct practice cannot possibly
    give rise to frustration, nor complacency on the other extreme,
    because even if your attention is directed towards <u>**frustration
    or complacency**</u>, your sole task is to discern its
    simultaneously present <du>**background**</du>, so that you are
    unable to take the ownership of those mental states and act out of
    them. It is only through ayoniso manasikāra that those arisen mental
    states become unwholesome, and it is what enables you to succumb to
    them in any way:

    > “And what, bhikkhus, is the nutriment for the arising of unarisen
    > ill will and for the increase and expansion of arisen ill will?
    > There is, bhikkhus, the basis of resistance/repulsion/opposition
    > (paṭigha). **Cultivating ayoniso manasikāra** towards it is the
    > nutriment for the arising of unarisen ill will and for the
    > increase and expansion of arisen ill will.”
    >
    > — <cite>SN 46.2</cite>

    *Yoniso manasikāra* is the way to abandon hindrances and unwholesome
    states. Therefore, as already explained, one must not expect a
    solution to those states to come from changing the *content* of
    manasikāra (e.g. directing the dog towards the forest instead of the
    village, in the above simile); The solution is knowing the womb of
    manasikāra *while* it’s taking place, while the dog pulls on the
    rope. This is what leads to the mind becoming “quite secluded from
    unwholesome states” in the first jhāna, while the senses are still
    very much still operational. You don’t run away from the enticing or
    irritating <u>**things that pressure you**</u> and towards
    “<u>**thoughts of Dhamma**</u>”—how will you *understand* the
    gratification, danger and escape from those pressures by burying
    your head in the <u>**sand**</u> when they arise? This is not even a
    true escape. Rather, it’s precisely by not losing the
    <du>**context**</du> (the “strong pillar”) *while* the
    <u>**pressure**</u> is there that one gets to understand and become
    dispassionate *towards* the pressure correctly—one gets to abandon
    the appropriation and delight in the *senses* (the core of the
    issue), not only their objects.[^21]

    Even when the Buddha spoke of “attending to a different sign
    (*nimitta*)”,[^22] this should be understood as re-establishing the
    context or *yoni*—a context is what a “*nimitta*” is, it’s not a
    mystical vision or some specific thought. This is exactly why the
    Buddha here employs the simile of a <du>***subtler*** **peg**</du>
    to knock out a <u>**coarser one**</u>, not a new <u>**coarse
    peg**</u> to replace the old <u>**coarse peg**</u>.

    This peripheral context, the “subtler peg”, is a <du>**thought of
    Dhamma**</du> on the right level, not rooted in impulsive aversion
    towards the pressure of that which is attended to. In another
    simile, it’s how you get to see <u>**“the drink”**</u> as deadly
    poison correctly, without anxiously denying its pleasantness, which
    is precisely what would abolish any chance of seeing what the true
    poison is and escaping it… apart from drinking it of course.

    > “Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a bronze cup of a beverage having a
    > fine colour, aroma, and taste, but it was mixed with poison. Then
    > a man would come along, oppressed and afflicted by the heat,
    > tired, parched, and thirsty. They would tell him: ‘Good man, this
    > beverage in the bronze cup **has a fine colour, aroma, and taste,
    > but it is mixed with poison**. Drink it if you wish. If you drink
    > it, **it will gratify you**[^23] with its colour, aroma, and
    > taste, **but** by drinking it you will meet death or deadly
    > suffering.’ Then the man would think: ‘I can quench my thirst with
    > water, whey, porridge, or soup, but I should not drink that

    >
    > So too, bhikkhus, whatever ascetics and brahmins in the past … in

    > are abandoning craving. In abandoning craving … they are freed
    > from suffering, I say.”
    >
    > — <cite>SN 12.66</cite>

    Namely, those who liberate themselves do not *deny* the pleasantness
    and agreeability of things (by means of management of their
    *attention*), but instead see the danger (by means of *yoniso
    manasikāra*) in *accepting* that agreeability, in *drinking* the
    beverage. They see the danger of *ayoniso manasikāra*. This may
    sound obvious, but the only reason a person does not already see the
    Four Noble Truths is because this is still not correctly understood,
    and on some level they still either overly accept or overly deny the
    poisonous beverage. It takes much more to see the Middle Way than
    just a theoretical agreement with the Suttas.

4.  “Attending to that which is pleasant and agreeable” is in a way not
    a matter of choice. **Whatever** you choose to <u>**attend to**</u>,
    *that’s* what you regard as beautiful and attractive at the time,
    *including your contemplation of Dhamma*, when it’s taken as a
    <u>**foreground**</u> to *replace* what bothers you and not a
    <du>**peripheral context**</du> to be *unmoved* by what bothers you.
    Hence, one would automatically be meditating on the danger of lust
    or asubha in a lustful manner for instance, i.e. *ayoniso*, simply
    by doing it with the *direct attention* which is always in itself
    “pleasant and agreeable” (because it’s always regarded as
    “mine”).[^25] This will still be rooted in craving against pain,
    just like acting out of desires is always rooted in craving against
    the pain they cause when unfulfilled. The way is to see the danger
    and lack of satisfaction as the surrounding “*womb*” of that
    pressure *while* it is present. This is the level where the true
    “contemplation of danger” occurs:

    > “Herein, what are the six kinds of equanimity based on the
    > household life? On seeing a form with the eye,
    > <u>**equanimity**</u> arises in a foolish infatuated ordinary
    > person, in an untaught ordinary person who has not conquered the
    > <u>**boundary**</u> \[of the domain of attention\], who has not

    Replacing <u>**attractive mental images**</u> with <u>**repulsive
    ones**</u>, as the practice of asubha is often done, is a perfect
    example of equanimity that does not transcend sense objects. It
    simply involves changing one appropriated object with another, and
    if one stops doing it, the lust will return unchanged.[^26] Same
    goes for covering up <u>**disagreeable experiences**</u> with
    <u>**thoughts of “loving-kindness”**</u>. One must rather *see
    through* the <u>**attractive/irritating**</u> things by discerning
    the <du>**simultaneous context**</du> which is larger than them,
    which results in the correct asubha/mettā, the *inability* to be
    lustful/angry even when beautiful/angering things arise.

    > — <cite>Itivuttaka 3.39</cite>

5.  The reason why samādhi is always compared with “immovability” is not
    because attention has become fixated on one thing and all mental
    movement has grinded to a halt. It’s because, by sufficiently having
    discerned the *yoni* of your attention, you are incapable of
    overlooking it, incapable of *ayoniso*, and thus all attention will
    take place within a wholesome background (*yoniso*), even attention
    towards the things that used to induce unwholesome. This is because
    they did so due the *ayoniso* way of attending them, not in
    themselves. This is the reason why samādhi is essential to fully
    develop *yoniso manasikāra* and become an Arahant.

    Furthermore, the term “*ekaggatā*”, being one of the factors of
    samādhi and usually interpreted due to Commentarial influences as
    “one-pointedness”, is actually closer in meaning to “having one
    peak, one foremost part”. It is obvious that, even in a mundane
    sense, in order to distinguish something as a “peak”, it must be
    surrounded by other features that are lower than it. In the same
    way, *yoniso manasikāra*, which *inevitably* leads to samādhi when
    cultivated correctly, entails seeing that “womb” of whatever
    peripheral context one takes as a practice, as the
    “<du>**peak**</du>” in comparison to whatever is taking place in the
    domain of attention. The unshakable prominence of that “peak” in
    regard to <u>**all else that arises**</u> is what gives rise to
    “imperturbability’”, not the *absence* of other things arising
    through concentrating on one thing alone.

6.  It is essential not to fall into the attitude that more attempts at
    *yoniso manasikāra* automatically constitute higher quality of
    effort. The whole point is that we are within that “womb” whether we
    see it or not, and have been so always. So by anxiously trying to
    see it all the time, the value gets placed on the content of
    *attention* again. That which needs to be known as the
    <du>**basis**</du> for all objects of attention gets turned into
    another <u>**object of attention**</u>.

    So, one has to remind oneself and re-establish recollection only
    when the context has clearly been lost[^27] not all the time
    neurotically. Then you also get to see that “losing the context” is
    a choice, because you *are* within that container, you *are* within
    the body even if you don’t think about it, so only ignorant
    *choices* by which the primacy of the “womb” is clearly disregarded
    and ownership is implied, can actually make you believe that you are
    the first, the master, and the womb is second. For example, it is
    impossible to seek pleasing experiences for the sake of sensual
    gratification or act out of indignation towards disagreeable
    experiences without tacitly assuming that you *are* the owner of the
    six senses and body. This is how you would automatically ignore,
    through your superficially unrelated actions, that this notion of
    “I” and “mine” is actually *within* that body and thus cannot truly
    possess it—and this is how *yoniso manasikāra* would be forsaken and
    *ayoniso* become established.

    The foremost obstacle to *yoniso manasikāra* is nothing other than
    one’s own lack of restraint and unwholesome choices:

    > Bhikkhus, without having abandoned six things, one is
    > **incapable** of \[practicing the four satipaṭṭhānas\]. What six?
    > Delight in work, delight in talk, delight in sleep, delight in
    > company, not guarding the doors of the sense faculties, and being
    > immoderate in eating. Without having abandoned these six things,
    > one is incapable of practicing the four satipaṭṭhānas.
    >
    > — <cite>AN 6.117</cite>

    Thus, if you simply recollect the context and *know* that the yoni
    is there, and doen’t become overly engaged with whatever comes
    within that “womb”, including thoughts, you have *not* lost the
    recollection, even without actively thinking about it. Even if your
    mind is trying to hinder you and cause you doubt to revisit and
    rehash all your Dhamma knowledge, that’s still not an excuse to put
    the doubt first and the *yoni* second. If the context is there, the
    discomfort of whatever perceptions and mental states come within
    that needs to be *endured*—not wanting to endure it would put you
    “outside of the womb”. You would willingly delight in “birth” again,
    and further sustain ignorance.[^28]

    You *shouldn’t* have to be thinking about the *yoni* constantly
    because that would again be “yoni-manasikāra” and not
    “yoni**so**-manasikāra”: attending **to** the womb instead of “from”
    or “in terms of” the womb. If you don’t choose to ignore it, the
    *yoni* will stay there because it *can’t* not be there. You can’t
    *actually* be outside of it even if you want to, and this is
    essentially why there is suffering: our attitude contradicts the
    true state of affairs. The more you regard yourself (your attention)
    as *first* and the fundamental container of it as *second*, the more
    you will suffer. The Dhamma is the invariable nature of things, and
    ignorance is an *inversion* that stubbornly ignores that nature,
    while the nature itself remains unchanged:

    > “Bhikkhus, there are these four inversions of perception,
    > inversions of mind, and inversions of view. What four? (1) The
    > inversion of perception, mind, and view that takes the impermanent
    > to be permanent; (2) the inversion of perception, mind, and view
    > that takes what is suffering to be pleasurable; (3) the inversion
    > of perception, mind, and view that takes what is non-self to be
    > self; (4) the inversion of perception, mind, and view that takes
    > what is unattractive to be attractive. These are the four
    > inversions of perception, mind, and view.
    >
    > — <cite>AN 4.49</cite>

    These inversions are the corollaries of *ayoniso manasikāra*, and
    *yoniso manasikāra* is the only thing that can undo them.
