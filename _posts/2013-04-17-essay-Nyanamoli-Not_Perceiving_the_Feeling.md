The Teaching is for the one who feels. When one thinks “this is what I
feel”, that is what one *thinks*, not what one *feels*. Feeling cannot
be thought, it cannot be perceived. What one perceives is one’s
perception, what one feels is one’s feeling.[^1] Feeling and perception
are simply *there*, superimposed, independent and different in nature.

**“What one feels, that one perceives.”**

**Thinking that it is *the same* thing that one feels and
*simultaneously* perceives, means one *assumes* that \[same\] thing as
*independent* of that feeling and perception. That thing *is*.**

**Thinking that it is *a different* thing that one feels and
*simultaneously* perceives, means one *assumes* that \[different\] thing
as *independent* of that feeling and perception. That thing *is*.**

**Thinking that it is *both-the-same-and-different* thing that one feels
and *simultaneously* perceives, means one *assumes* that
\[both-the-same-and-different\] thing as *independent* of that feeling
and perception. That thing *is*.**

**Thinking that it is *neither-the-same-nor-different* thing that one
feels and *simultaneously* perceives, means one *assumes* that
\[neither-the-same-nor-different\] thing as *independent* of that
feeling and perception. That thing *is*.**

**Thus, through that assumption, one *identifies* that thing.**

Whether one thinks it is the same, or different, or both or neither,
feeling is there, *regardless* of the perception in regard to it. Thus,
a feeling cannot be thought, it can only be *felt*. A perception cannot
be felt, it can only be *perceived*. One has to learn *how to feel*, or
how to *know* ‘that because of which’ the feeling is.[^2] This means how
to *discern* it from that which perception is. This cannot be done by
separating feeling and perception and examining them individually.[^3]
So how can one do it then?

**By *feeling* \[the feeling\]. By *perceiving* \[the perception\]. By
*cognizing* \[the cognizance\].**

**By *cognizing feeling* <u>while</u> perceiving.**

**By *understanding* cognizing.**

**By *not-conceiving* perception.**

If the superimposition of these two completely independent
simultaneously present domains is understood, the assumption of *an
independent thing*,[^4] outside of feeling and perception ceases to be
“a bridge” for the two. The ‘thing’ which is being *identified* (as the
same, different, both-the-same-and-different,
neither-the-same-nor-different), is that “bridge” and feeling and
perception ‘meet’ or ‘come together’ because of it. That thing is
assumed *to be that* which one *feels* and *perceives*.[^5] In this way,
feeling and perception (and consciousness) also come to be
*identified*.[^6] Thus, that ‘\[assumption of a\] thing’ which
identifies the *unidentifiable* [^7] feeling and perception makes them
*manifest in* that *identity*-feeling and perception come to *exist*.
The identity feels, the identity perceives-*I* feel, *I* perceive.

**One feels pleasure, one feels pain, one feels
neither-pain-nor-pleasure.**

**One perceives blue, one perceives yellow, one perceives red, one
perceives white.**[^8]

One can be *aware* of what one feels; one can also be *aware* of what
one perceives. *Through understanding that because of which one is aware
of*, one *knows* the feeling and perception *structurally* cannot
overlap or merge or “be bridged” or identified;[^9] This makes the
*assumption* in regard to feeling and perception (as the same,
different, both-the-same-and-different,
neither-the-same-nor-different),[^10] *redundant*, *irrelevant*, *not
worth maintaining*. Why? Because it does not and it cannot make *any
difference* to the *structural order* of things (feeling feels,
perception perceives). If it could, the freedom from suffering would not
be possible.[^11] Fully understanding that whichever way one’s thought
(assumption) goes, the feeling cannot be *identified* as (the same,
different, both-the-same-and-different, neither-the-same-nor-different
from) perception, leaves that feeling and that perception just standing
there – *indifferent* to each other.[^12] [^13]

**Agreeable perception is assumed *to be that* which is pleasantly
felt;**

**Disagreeable perception is assumed *to be that* which is unpleasantly
felt;**

**Neutral perception is assumed *to be that* which is neutrally felt.**

Thus, one thinks it is *this sight* [^14] (sounds, smells…thoughts)
*that is felt*. Because of that feeling one sets upon to ‘affect’ those
sights (sounds, smells, …thoughts), sets upon to change them, modify
them, adjust them, pursue them, avoid them; one gets *entangled* in the
sights (sounds, smells…thoughts) *on account of what* one feels *when
they are* . Knowing that feeling is *just there*-being felt, and
perception is *just there*-being perceived, makes further entanglement
*impossible*, and any entanglement that was there[^15] is made
redundant, disowned, dropped down, never to picked up again. Why?
Because it was structurally impossible to get entangled in the first
place, but until one has fully understood that, one’s
‘not-knowing-that-one-cannot-be-entangled’ *was one’s entanglement.*
When one understands that the arisen things cannot structurally *relate*
to each other-feeling feels the feeling, perception perceives the
perception[^16]—*concern* becomes impossible or *inconceivable-dukkha*
completely ceases, never to arise again.

[^1]: Cf. Ñāṇavīra Thera, <cite>Clearing the Path</cite>, SAÑÑĀ, §2.

[^2]: Or how to not-conceive ‘that because of which’ perception is.

[^3]: Thinking it in isolation from the present experience (i.e. from
    perception and consciousness) would amount to this. Since the
    separation cannot actually occur (not even in one’s imagination),
    all one can do is assume that which is different between those
    three.

[^4]: The \[sense of\] independence is the inevitable outcome of the
    presence of the assumption in one’s experience. It is not therefore
    accidental that one’s sense of Self is always regarded as an
    extra-temporal and changeless, i.e. independent (from the rest of
    the experience). Cf. Ñāṇavīra Thera, op.cit., ATTĀ, §1 and L.147,
    §3.

[^5]: Thus, because of this assumption, one feels the thing, not one’s
    feelings; one perceives the thing, not one’s perception. By doing so
    one conceives things different to what they are, and when those
    things change one suffers.

[^6]: Cf. my essay Determining Determinations. ‘That because of which’
    \[feeling, perception, consciousness are\] is assumed as ‘that
    which’ feeling, perception, consciousness ‘are’.

[^7]: “It is not possible to separate them and by separating them point
    out the difference…” — <cite>MN 43</cite>.

[^8]: Cf. <cite>MN 43</cite>.

[^9]: Or cross into each other’s domains.

[^10]: All of these are forms of identity.

[^11]: Cf. my essay <cite>The Infinity of Mind</cite>.

[^12]: By understanding this structural ‘indifference’, one feels
    indifferent to the whole structure-which is what upekkhā is.

[^13]: It is the nature of the superimposition that breeds this
    indifference, since concern is in its nature always in relation to
    something.

[^14]: Disagreeable (or agreeable, or neutral)

[^15]: In the past, or possible in the future, or standing there in the
    present.

[^16]: Matter matters, feeling feels, perception perceives,
    determinations determine, consciousness cognizes.
