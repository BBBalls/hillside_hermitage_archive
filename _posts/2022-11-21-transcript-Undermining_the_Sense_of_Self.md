title: 296hh- Undermining the Sense of Self
---

**Ajahn Nyanamoli:** What would be the measure of success in this
practice?

**Q:** The full development of <span lang="pi">*anatta*</span>.

**Nm:** How does one go about developing that?…

It’s not enough to just say, “Oh, this is not mine, not I am, not
myself.” To do that, first, you need to discern that *sense of self*
correctly, and then you need to see it as *not yours* and not as an
independent master existing outside of this situation.

It’s not about finding an answer to the question of “What is myself and
not-self..?”, and so on. It’s about the mental practice of whatever that
*sense of self* is, in whichever way it endures, to see it as second, as
within, as fully enclosed within this inescapable limits of this
situation as a whole—body posture, feeling, perceptions, intentions and
so on—then sustain that view. You might then ask, “What’s next?”. But
that’s it.

You will of course fall from that view, and you certainly won’t even do
it right the first time. But, if you know that’s what you’re supposed to
do, i.e not try to remove the *sense of self*, but simply set up the
correct way of attending to it, by way of
<span lang="pi">*yoniso*</span> of that attention, (Peripherally knowing
it concurrently with that which is being attended.) then you stand a
chance for that view to take root.

You can presently recollect your *sense of self* now as we speak. It
doesn’t matter whether it’s exemplified through a clear thought or
ambiguous *sense of I am sitting here*. That *I am*, it’s obviously not
this physical thing. It’s not about denying that I am, trying to force
it into not-self, or dismissing it as unimportant. No, you want that
*sense of self* to be known for what it is, and for that you need it to
endure in clear comprehension, while there is this situation of this
body, perception, sounds, mouth, taste, touches, etc enduring.

If that’s too complex, you could simply see, “Okay, there is this
*situation as a whole* based on this body to whatever extent it is, and
there is this *sense of self enduring* there as well.”

Do you see that? Do you see your *sense of self* enduring simultaneously
on a different plane from your five senses, your thoughts, and
everything else? Here and yonder, the situation of this infinite space
and my *sense of self* perpendicular to that, simultaneously here?

At any given time, it doesn’t matter what you’re engaged with, if
someone were to ask you who you are, you would have that recognition of
*your self* right there. The point is to not bother trying to define who
you are or who *I am*. Just discern it enduring there as this
weird-ambiguous-phenomenon that you can never put your finger on, but
it’s always there. The point is to not even bother trying to put a
finger on it but to not lose sight of it as something that is always
there lingering in the background.

As much as your body, your current posture, your feeling, and your
perception are the basis of that inescapability of this situation, here
and yonder, the image of the self—or the notion of the self—is equally
the other end of the inescapability of your situation. You are not
outside of that image either. When you recognize these two things: the
body and situation as a whole are there on their own, you can then
realize, “Oh, this phenomenon is there on its own, as a result of this
here, that is also on its own.”

The *sense of self* being more ambiguous, more in the background, less
palpable, less measurable, naturally gets bundled with that aroma of
subjectivity, of *mine*, and *I am*, because it feels *above* or
*behind* all of this. It’s the observer of all of this. And it doesn’t
matter what kind of observer it is, and how it might feel. The only
reason it can be an observer is because there is this to be observed. If
there is nothing to be observed, the observer would not be—because
nothing is defining it.

Recognize that it’s not that the observer comes first and this, the
rest, comes second. No, it’s *“with the observer, the observed is”*.
With the observed—felt, perceived, tasted, touched—the observer is. If
your mind is calm within that principle, and you have room to move
without falling off from it—from this type of *samadhi*—you can then
think about various particular aspects of that relationship. But,
fundamentally, the point is simply to get very used to having the *sense
of self* endure simultaneously with having this experience endure as it
changes, as you speak, move, and stand up, and so on. Two simultaneous
things at the same time - “two points of view”. If you become familiar
with that, because you’ve been looking for it, then that
self-centered—one point of view—at the same time will be undermined
simply through that. (For *self* to remain standing, there needs to be
one point of view, not two. If there are two there is not one.)

The Buddha taught the undermining of the sense of self, the undermining
of the one, through seeing the two simultaneously present. A person has
to understand and see that. Not just think, “Oh, that’s a lovely idea. I
have faith in it.” but rather, one has to see it and then stick to
repeatedly seeing it out of faith. And as a result, even without making
effort towards more specific clarifications, you will arrive at the
final goal.

By understanding and holding to that principle, keeping it clear—*with
this, this is; without this, this would not be*, anything else that you
assume is *in between*, anything pertaining to *mine* or *subjectivity*
will evaporate.

All the other contemplations you find in the Suttas are all for
exercising this same principle to completely remove any trace of
conceit. For example, the recollection of this body that I’m enclosed
with is dependent upon that which it isn’t - namely food. The phenomenon
of food being present is why this body is alive. If you take that away,
the body will not be able to remain.

If you cultivate this right way of viewing, based on the precepts, sense
restraint, and solitude, you will be able to handle it, not be
overwhelmed with anxiety and can take it to its conclusion - complete
*Nibbana*. If, however, you try to bypass those prerequisites, the
anxiety that will appear due to not seeing any ground for yourself to
stand upon will overwhelm you. But, if you have been cultivating the
Gradual Training beforehand, this view will be liberating. That
undermining the *sense of self*, in that indirect manner, will feel like
a relief from a burden, from the tension, from the pressure of
existence. The clearer the view becomes—*with this, this is*—two
simultaneous things. Even if you don’t specifically think about the
ownership and uprooting it, it is being uprooted.

Sometimes people mystify it and say, “Oh, it’s the observer, the pure
consciousness, the knower, the this, the that…” It’s just different
phrasing for the same thing—*I am*. And that’s not the way out. Never
has been. You want to see that it doesn’t matter how lofty, how remote,
how distant, or how great that observer or the knower might feel. Would
it be there if this situation is not enduring the way it is? No. Thus
*‘with this, this is’*. That all-knowing seer, the knower, it’s pretty
much to the same extent, not a bit more, not a bit less, subjected to
the same things that all of this is subjected to—impermanence,
suffering, and unownability. It doesn’t matter how it feels, what
matters is that it ceases to be assumed as *yours*. Whether that *sense
of self* feels coarse or lofty, refined, pleasant or unpleasant, it’s
just the reflection of the same principle that’s here, nothing else.
That’s the true unburdening because there is no more of that assumed
center that takes all the weight on.

**Q:** Getting used to this type of contemplation will lessen its
dissonance with one’s sense of security and sense of self. The first
time you realize that something you thought was so solid and so secure
is just a flimsy house of cards, it’s terrifying. But now, if it’s just
a house of cards, it’s just a house of cards, you don’t expect anything
else.

**Nm:** If through the Gradual Training, you stop adding more fuel to
the fire of passion, aversion, and ownership, then the more of the same
recognition that *this is a flimsy house of cards which is going to
collapse*, will be cultivated. The more you have that established, the
less unpleasant it will be. And it was unpleasant, not because of its
recognition, but because of your emotional involvement with the house of
cards, dependence on it, views, refusal to allow it to be otherwise—out
of that gratuitous sense of ownership of the self-centered experience.

Now if doubt, regarding the principle of that simultaneous view, arises,
you can, if the view has been established, see that doubt as also second
to it. The purpose isn’t to avoid doubts, but rather to overcome them
with the same principle of non-ownership. Doubt cannot access that which
precedes it, which is its necessary basis.
