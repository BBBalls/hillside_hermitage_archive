title: 140hh- There’s No Love In Loving-kindness
---

**Q:** Our recent discussions have centred around cultivating the
Brahmavihāras. From my perspective, it’s crucial to differentiate and
comprehend each of the four components of an unobstructed
<span lang="pi">*Brahmavihāra*</span> mind—namely:
<span lang="pi">*mettā*</span>, <span lang="pi">*karuṇā*</span>,
<span lang="pi">*muditā*</span>, and
<span lang="pi">*upekkhā*</span>—individually. But only after
establishing and stabilising <span lang="pi">*mettā*</span>, can one
start discerning <span lang="pi">*karuṇā*</span>,
<span lang="pi">*muditā*</span>, and <span lang="pi">*upekkhā*</span>
‘one by one’.

**Nm:** Instead of saying that it’s developed ‘one by one’ it is more
accurate to say that it’s developed ‘one within the other’. Through
understanding what <span lang="pi">*mettā*</span> is, you understand the
principle of all four <span lang="pi">*Brahmavihāras*</span>. Then
within that understanding and development of
<span lang="pi">*mettā*</span>, you can develop
<span lang="pi">*karuṇā*</span>, and within
<span lang="pi">*karuṇā*</span>, you get to build
<span lang="pi">*muditā*</span>; which then results in the fulfilment of
<span lang="pi">*upekkhā*</span>. You don’t abandon
<span lang="pi">*mettā*</span> to develop
<span lang="pi">*karuṇā*</span>, or <span lang="pi">*karuṇā*</span> to
develop <span lang="pi">*muditā*</span>, nor do you leave all three to
develop <span lang="pi">*upekkhā*</span>.
<span lang="pi">*Upekkhā*</span> encompasses them all. But to arrive at
it, you have to go “through” them all. <span lang="pi">*Upekkhā*</span>
is founded upon <span lang="pi">*mettā*</span>. It’s the same in terms
of <span lang="pi">*jhana*</span>; if you keep following the principle
of the first <span lang="pi">*jhana*</span>, you will arrive at the
fourth.

**Q:** Regarding <span lang="pi">*mettā*</span> specifically, it refers
to an attitude of non-aversion rather than engaging in friendly social
interactions or cultivating forms of love.

**Nm:** Correct. The framework of <span lang="pi">*Brahmavihāra*</span>
centres on cultivating a mind of non-aversion. This means that even when
encountering unpleasant sights, sounds, smells, tastes, or touches, one
does not have ill will towards them. The focus is on prioritising the
protection of the mind of non-aversion, regardless of the content of
one’s everyday experience.

**Q:** This differs from popular ideas of <span lang="pi">*mettā*</span>
practice, which usually consist of generating love and sending it in
various directions.

**Nm:** The problem with this is that such a practice will not uproot
craving, which is why that is not what is meant by the description of
<span lang="pi">*mettā*</span> in the suttas. People prefer that method
because it is more palpable, and ‘nicer,’ and it’s certainly a helpful
way of relating to people. In any case, it is better to think of people
with loving kindness rather than hatred, because if you are not hating
them, then more often than not they will not hate you back; which will
help you out at that societal level. So I am not saying that you
shouldn’t do it—by all means think positively about everyone, but don’t
mistake that for practising the Dhamma.

It is dangerous to rely on personal feelings as the basis for one’s
practice: simply because something makes you feel good, does not
necessarily mean that it is the practice of Dhamma. Our emotions are
shaped by our *resistance to* or *indulgence in* certain behaviours or
experiences, and therefore, they cannot be relied upon to determine what
is wholesome or unwholesome. So it is crucial to conduct a comprehensive
inquiry into the Buddha’s concept of \[*mettā*\]\]{lang=pi}, understand
its deeper meaning and practise it with wisdom and discernment, rather
than relying on subjective feelings.

The term <span lang="pi">*mettā*</span> refers to the general framework
or *mind of non-aversion*. It is important to emphasise this because one
may not harbour aversion towards someone in particular, but still hold
hatred towards another, indicating the lack of
<span lang="pi">*mettā*</span> in one’s general mindset. Even if one
does not hate anyone specifically, the absence of that particular
aversion alone does not signify the development of
<span lang="pi">*mettā*</span>. To truly cultivate this mindset, one
must make a conscious effort to abandon all *possibility* of aversion in
all directions and protect and maintain that, regardless of the
circumstances or the people they encounter. Thus, it’s about removing
the possibility of aversion, not the possibility of meeting disagreeable
and unpleasant people and experiences.

The choice to prioritise immediate circumstances over the mind of
non-aversion is a choice to abandon the framework necessary for the
development of <span lang="pi">*mettā*</span>. By protecting and
cherishing the general mindset like a mother would protect her child, as
stated in the <cite>Mettā sutta</cite>, one will prevent actions that
stem from a mind of aversion, and thus protect all living beings as
well.

Also, it is essential to note that the development of
<span lang="pi">*mettā*</span> does not result in having *love* for all:
it leads to the development of <span lang="pi">*upekkhā*</span>, or
equanimity, which is the ability to maintain an unshakable mind toward
all things without attachments.

**Q:** Love breeds infatuation, not equanimity.

**Nm:** Yes, and it also makes you susceptible to aversion, fear, and
anxiety, because now you depend on it emotionally and existentially.

**Q:** So if you can’t see the direct connection between
<span lang="pi">*mettā*</span> and <span lang="pi">*upekkhā*</span>,
your definition of <span lang="pi">*mettā*</span> needs redefining. And
in terms of <span lang="pi">*karunā*</span>, how can we get to that
stage?

**Nm:** You just have to take the same principle of
<span lang="pi">*mettā*</span> a step further. Initially, when
encountering something disagreeable, one may feel aversion towards it.
Then, one can develop a mind of non-aversion towards the unpleasant, but
there may still be some resistance. By further developing the mind of
non-aversion, one begins to refine the *principle of non-resistance*
that underlies all four <span lang="pi">*Brahmavihāra*</span>. That
non-resistance is the abandoning of craving, cruelty, and any conflict.

**Q:** Regarding whatever is felt, pleasant or unpleasant: if it’s
unpleasant, you should practise non-resistance. And if it’s pleasant,
you must not be trying to possess it?

**Nm:** People are inclined to pursue pleasant things because there is a
simultaneous resistance to the pain of desire. The urge for pleasure
stems from an aversion to one’s current state. One resists even pleasure
and desires to change it when it isn’t sufficient (and it never is for
one who craves it). Therefore, by cultivating
<span lang="pi">*Brahmavihāra*</span>, one can overcome sensuality too,
which involves resistance.

**Q:** Maintaining a peaceful mind towards all *feelings* is the core
practice.

**Nm:** Yes.

**Q:** With the <span lang="pi">*Brahmavihāra*</span> practice, you
cannot hurt anyone…

**Nm:** …because the intention to hurt, to engage in sensuality, or to
be cruel, is always rooted in resisting whatever you are feeling at the
time. Unwholesome actions require *resistance to feeling* as their
necessary condition.

**Q:** Moreover, when individuals have established and stabilised their
mind in <span lang="pi">*mettā*</span> and
<span lang="pi">*karunā*</span>, a sense of contentment arises within
them, irrespective of the feeling experienced. This contentment is known
as <span lang="pi">*muditā*</span>.

<div lang="en">

</div>

**Nm**: ‘Altruistic joy,’ which is the usual translation of
<span lang="pi">*muditā*</span>, is not accurate.
<span lang="pi">*Muditā*</span> stems from the principle we’re
discussing here of non-resistance and non-contention towards others and
whatever circumstances arise; safeguarding your mind of benevolence,
which harms no other being. The result is that the mind becomes
imperturbable to any circumstance (or maybe ‘conflict’?).

So as a sense of joy, it’s similar to the joy you get in
<span lang="pi">*jhana*</span>—joy that you’re secluded and unaffected,
free of concern regarding the entire world. You can see how equanimity
regarding good or bad is developed from that.

**Q:** Another description of <span lang="pi">*muditā*</span> can be
found in <cite>AN 3.95</cite>:

<div lang="en">

> And what is the harmonious assembly? Here, the assembly in which the
> bhikkhus dwell in concord, harmoniously, without disputes, blending
> like milk and water, viewing each other with eyes of affection, is
> called the harmonious assembly.
>
> “When the bhikkhus dwell in concord, harmoniously, without disputes,
> blending like milk and water, viewing each other with eyes of
> affection, on that occasion, they generate much merit. On that
> occasion, the bhikkhus dwell in a divine abode, that is, in the
> liberation of the mind through muditā. When one is content, *pīti*
> (happiness) arises. For one with a happy mind, the body becomes calm.
> One calm in the body feels pleasure. For one feeling such pleasure,
> the mind becomes composed.

</div>

**Nm:** The best way to cultivate a friendly attitude towards all is to
focus on maintaining your mind of friendliness and non-resistance
towards how you feel, and then protect it as a mother protects her
child. When you don’t mind experiencing disagreeable feelings, it
becomes inconceivable to hate the person who seemingly caused those
feelings. You don’t need to manage all your various individual
relationships or circumstances if the
<span lang="pi">*Brahmavihāra*</span> framework is developed—quite the
contrary.

You find that mental “gateway”, through which other beings or
circumstances have to arise and instead of chasing, managing, dealing
with, or trying to prevent those circumstances, you realise, “All I need
to do is protect the gateway and not lose sight of it”. And you protect
it by not acting out of it.

**Q:** Which results in peacefulness?

**Nm:** Peacefulness will come as a result of it, as a culmination of
the absence of your resistance towards what you feel. Peace is not about
*not* feeling pain. Peace is about not being disturbed by pain or being
pulled by pleasures.

**Q:** Non-conflict.

**Nm:** Yes, non-conflict internally. Can you have a conflict with
anybody externally without already being conflicted with what you’re
feeling internally? Impossible.

Trying to eliminate conflict from the external world is futile because
the source of conflict is internal. It is by resolving your internal
conflict that it becomes impossible for external events to disturb you,
even if the whole world is conflicting with you.
