The practice of *asubha* is about attending to the ugly context or
non-beautiful side of a beautiful thing, rather than attending to
something else that is ugly. You need to see through the beautiful thing
to the other side of it, which is simultaneously present; otherwise the
attraction to the beautiful will not be stopped. This is because the
attraction to beauty is not in the beauty itself, but in how you
perceive it.

Many people try to practice *asubha* by getting rid of the beautiful and
replacing it with some other ugly thing. This approach treats the two as
separate entities rather than recognizing the presence of both within
the same phenomenon, and implies blaming the beautiful for any
disturbance. But by doing so, you fail to see that the problem is
actually in your attitude towards it.

The right approach is to attend to the beautiful things correctly when
they arise; with the right attention, and discern their opposite side or
counterpart that is implicitly present in the background. This way, you
can see through the beauty and realize that it is just ‘less ugly’. Such
a context then serves as a basis for the relinquishing of passion
towards the beautiful.

Even if you are not currently engaging in sensual pleasure, as long as
you maintain the view that pleasure is valuable, you are keeping the
basis for future lust to arise. Only if you fully understand the danger
in sensual gratification can you free yourself from sensuality once and
for all. Developing the context of danger means discerning the implicit
characteristics of what you are attending, with the chief characteristic
being the danger. By discerning the implicit danger long enough, you
will not need to maintain that context because it is not something that
you create, but rather it is something that you uncover.

The counterpart of life: death, is always present in that negative
sense, even if you don’t attend to it. If you understand this, you will
experience disenchantment with life, and it will be impossible for you
to remain attracted to it. Passion towards life is not the product of
life itself. It comes from thinking or having a view that life is in
your control, from feeling like it will not end or will last forever,
i.e ignoring the context of death. By removing these misconceptions, you
remove the basis for passion towards life. You don’t need to seek out
death or the possibility of death because it’s already here.

You also don’t need to deny life to remove misconceptions about it. It
is the same principle as how you can ‘get rid of’ sensual thoughts
indirectly: when a sensual thought arises, you must not welcome it or
entertain it. And by enduring it long enough, the thought will
eventually go away.

Similarly, you can free yourself from death by seeing the danger in life
and thus indirectly removing the slightest passion towards it. By
removing passion towards life, you remove the basis for death to apply
to you any longer. Then, when this body falls apart, you will not be
appearing anywhere else because you have severed any bond with the
entire domain of *saṃsāra*.

When you eat, your default mode is to prioritize the pleasure of eating.
You put taste first, even when you’re starving. You may not even realize
that you’re doing this, but you are automatically eating out of pleasure
rather than out of necessity. The evidence for this is the fact that you
eat even when you are not hungry.

However, there is another side to eating: the fact that it’s something
you have to do. It’s a necessity, not just a source of pleasure. When
you take this necessity for granted and cover it up with delight in
eating, you become picky and start preferring certain tastes over
others. But no matter how much you prioritize taste and delight in food,
cooking and recipes, the fact remains that you still need to eat – you
are subjected to that physical need. Whether you enjoy your food or not
makes no difference to that situation on which your life depends.

This is a reminder that hunger is a significant affliction. By ignoring,
or simply being unaware of the pressure and unpleasantness of being
subjected to the necessity of eating, you end up putting the pleasure
and taste first. But if you acknowledge the fact that food is a
necessity that you must fulfill, then whether you’re starving or not,
you can keep the context of why you need to eat in mind. Regardless of
how enjoyable or unpleasant the eating experience may be, it still stems
from the unpleasant fact of hunger which you are subjected to.

So by seeing the necessity of food as primary and taste as secondary,
you can become dispassionate towards taste without trying to suppress it
through various techniques. You can still taste something agreeable, but
no amount of agreeable or disagreeable taste will disturb your mind or
pervert the right order of putting first what is second and second what
is first: taste always comes second to hunger. So if there is no need
for food, you would not engage with it. And through recognising hunger
as the foremost illness and that determinations (that determine our life
– such as the necessity of food) as the foremost dis-ease, you can
understand that *Nibbāna*, or the state of liberation, is the foremost
ease.

This context is developed by recognizing the danger of delight. The
perception of non-delight is for the uprooting of the inherent delight
or joy in regard to the world, senses and sense objects.

The word ‘delight’ refers to that subtle attitude of acceptance or
looking forward to something; things that are pleasing and agreeable.
Agreeable things are not a problem in themselves. The problem is you
being unable to *not* delight in the prospect of pleasure. That is where
the danger is.

And so, delight itself is what renders you blind to the inherent danger
in being bound to delighting in agreeable and pleasant things. If you
genuinely apprehend and recognise that danger, it is impossible to
continue to delight in, or be attracted to those things.

‘Non-delight’ does not mean you must hate beautiful things. You simply
do not take up the pleasure in them anymore. If something is agreeable,
you acknowledge it as such, but there is no sense of taking up the
pleasure i.e delighting. Similarly, if something is disagreeable, you
recognize it as such, but there is no resistance to it.

Also, you can’t simply create a lack of delight out of thin air. The
only way to practice non-delight is by intentionally preventing yourself
from delighting. This involves contemplating and acknowledging the
potential dangers that come with the things that bring you pleasure. By
consistently cultivating such a state of non-delight over time, you
won’t have to continually remind yourself of the dangers, because they
have always been a natural part of those things. This is why freedom
from those things is possible in the first place.

Merely saying no to pleasant sights, sounds, smells, tastes and touches,
doesn’t automatically grant you a true understanding of delight. You
have the ability to restrain yourself and let go of non-essential
experiences, based on understanding that the pleasure they bring can be
detrimental. But there are certain things, such as eating, that you
cannot completely avoid. Even the Buddha, during his time as a
*bodhisatta*, attempted to starve himself in the belief that it would
lead to ultimate freedom, and came to realize that this approach was
incorrect. The issue was never the food itself: it is your attachment to
the delight derived from it that binds you to the aimless wanderings of
*saṃsāra*.

> 5-…When a *bhikkhu* becomes accustomed to the context of *anicca*,
> their mind draws back from acquisitions, honors, and fame, and either
> *upekkhā* or the counterpart gets established…

The counterpart to acquisition, ownership, honors, and fame is the
understanding of non-ownership, the realization that possession is
impossible—this is *anicca*. *Anicca* signifies change, but simply
stating “everything is changing” lacks a personal connection. You need
to perceive your own *anicca*: your experiences, ownership, body,
senses, feelings, and life are all *subject to change*. If seeing
*anicca* were to mean seeing a thing disappear, you would have to be
dead to understand that life is *anicca*, but then that understanding
would not be possible. Here lies the essence of the matter: recognizing
that something is “subject to change” implies that the potential for
change is inherent within it, even as the thing itself remains
unchanged.

So, to grasp that things are subject to change and subject to suffering
you should not wait for circumstances to transform before attempting to
understand *anicca*. You need to seek understanding while things are
still circumstantially stable and while your life is present. You want
to comprehend that change is an inherent aspect, an intrinsic
characteristic of anything that has arisen.

The nature of change reveals the nature of non-mastery, non-ownership,
and the impossibility of control. While things are manifested, you can
exert some level of influence and control. You have agency in your life
at this moment. However, fundamentally, you will lose that influence
when life itself decides to change—when you begin to experience the
decline of your physical body or when you pass away.

Acquisitions, honors, and fame all contribute to the escalation of one’s
sense of self. In the process of practice, a person initially focuses on
eliminating the most obvious forms of conceit, such as sensuality and
anger. However, as the practice deepens, one gradually relinquishes
subtler acquisitions related to nationality, lineage, family, cultural
affiliations, and so on.

Being popular is inherently desired and favored by people, while
obscurity and insignificance is inherently disliked. This is what leads
people to defensively react to criticism, even when there is no rational
basis for it. Yet all of that concern around reputation and self-image
is built upon the appropriation of those simple things that are so close
that they are taken for granted: your feelings, your experience as a
whole. So if one learns to recognise the impermanence of experience at
this basic, intimate level, one will naturally develop a discerning mind
that sees through any social pressures.

Rather than merely acknowledging the impermanence of things in general,
right contemplation involves recognizing that our present experience
arises from the functioning of our body and senses: these five
aggregates. Despite having some agency in our actions and decisions, we
fundamentally lack control over the changing nature of these aggregates.
Our entire domain of control is intertwined with their impermanence, and
when they change, our sense of control and the world we have constructed
will be swept away. By recognising this through your present experience,
you can understand that even what is currently within your control, is
*subject to change*. And that’s enough: you don’t have to wait for
external changes or seek ‘proof’ of impermanence in particular things.
You simply need to refrain from unwholesome actions in regard to things,
and based on this, discern that those things have impermanence
(*anicca*) as their inherent nature, whether you want it or not.
Diligently cultivating and maintaining that context would result in the
complete fading away of acquisitions, dependence on honors, fame, and
notions of conceit.

When you cultivate the understanding of *anicca* and let go of
attachments, criticism from others will no longer upset your mind. You
become unconcerned with what people think of you, whether their
judgments are fair or unfair. The irrational fear of blame no longer
distorts your perspective. The pressure to shape others’ perception of
you, rooted in conceit, also dissipates. You come to realize that you
cannot control others’ opinions. While many people grasp this concept
intellectually, the true transformation occurs when you emotionally
detach from the need for validation and are undisturbed by blame or
criticism. You maintain clarity in understanding the intentions behind
someone’s criticism and can objectively assess if there is validity in
their points. If you were indeed wrong, you have no issue acknowledging
and rectifying it, as you are not irrationally defending your own
conceited ownership. Likewise, when baseless criticism arises, you
recognize its absurdity, falsehood, or irrelevance. There is no pressure
to correct or ensure everyone knows the truth. You remain grounded in
your understanding and are free from the burden of rectifying the world
to fit a particular perception.

The context of danger needs to be established: the context that change
of an unfavorable kind can occur at any time. Once you recognise the
weight of that situation, you will feel the discomfort which is inherent
in the fact that your very being is not your own. In other words, if you
recognise *anicca* correctly, you will be recognising the inherent
discomfort of your situation – the *dukkha* will become apparent. And
the clearer that context is, the more of a ‘sense of urgency’ will
develop.

“Measurements due to conceiving” means what you conceive you
appropriate. You are measured and defined by the things you appropriate
(take as “mine”), such as your form, feelings, perceptions, intentions
and consciousness. When those things change, you are thus affected.
Removal of the conceivings on the other hand, means that whatever
happens with the things you used to conceive will not affect you
anymore. You will no longer be *measured* by it.
