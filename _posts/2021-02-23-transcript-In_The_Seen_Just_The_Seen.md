Can you have lust for things that you haven’t seen before? That’s
inconceivable because ‘having seen something’ is a prerequisite for
lust. You, however, are responsible for having lust towards the seen,
and one of the reasons why a person would have lust towards the seen is
because they take for granted that which is seen, they take for granted
the sense organs as their own, as the providers of pleasure and so on.
So then whatever you see, it’s only the thing you see, you are fully
centered around that but if you stop and think about it, it doesn’t
matter what you have lust towards, just look at the context of that
experience and reflect: “Ok, I have seen this, but which is more, things
I have seen in my life or things I haven’t seen?”. You will realise that
things you see or have seen will always be less compared to things you
haven’t seen. Even when some things you haven’t seen become that which
you have seen, still there will always be more of that which is not
seen.

Can you have lust towards that which is not seen? That’s inconceivable.
So the basis then, for non-lust is even greater than the basis for lust.
By thinking like this, you realize that anything you have seen was
purely circumstantial, you can realise: “I could have not seen it, it
could have not been”. When you have that framework or that established
context, anything else you see, will be seen against that context of “It
could have not arisen”, and you realise you have no say in that thing
arising, which in turn means that you will be less centered around
things you see, much less absorbed in objects, which means your basis
for the possibility of lust will be narrower. The loss of context, or
being absorbed into a sense experience without any peripheral awareness
in regard to it, that is where the lust breeds and multiplies.

Things you have seen are always secondary to things you haven’t seen,
which means that your lust for the seen is also secondary. Now, if you
were to cultivate the recognition of everything that you haven’t seen as
a necessary basis for non-lust, it will be impossible for you to
maintain the lust towards things that you are seeing here and now. Such
a practice is the undermining of that centredness upon things you have
seen, heard, sensed, cognised, and when I say ‘centredness’ I mean that
absorption in sense objects as a default mode of being. You need to
start eroding that gratuitous perception and one of the ways is
recognising that everything you have seen and will see, and seeing now,
is fundamentally circumstantial because it’s always against the backdrop
of everything else you have not seen. That can put the current lust
towards things you have seen in a better perspective.

If you develop the context that everything that has not been seen is
greater, the desire for things not seen won’t matter anymore because you
realise that it does not matter what you see in the future, it will
always be secondary to the framework of everything else not seen. If you
lust for new things, or things you have seen, that means you have lost
the recollection of the framework, the bigger picture, you have obscured
the context. It does not matter what you have seen, or how many times
you have seen it, by being seen, it becomes second. By acting out of
lust, you put those circumstantial things that have been seen, the
centre of your experience, which means you become dependent on that
which is already second. If you have lust, you are putting that which is
second first. The first (more primordial or fundamental) is everything
that is not seen, the circumstantial nature of seen, if you maintain
that recognition, it doesn’t matter what future seeing or possibility of
future seen, it will all have to come within the framework of everything
else not seen, and that’s exactly how you can develop your mind above
lust. You don’t develop your mind above lust by never perceiving
anything beautiful in the world, you develop your mind by not perverting
that order ever again in the world, it does not matter what you see.

The absence of lust is greater, that’s why it’s possible to overcome
sensuality because it’s fundamentally second, likewise with non-hate and
hate. If sensuality were truly rooted in the things themselves, things
you have seen and the way you see them, it would not be a problem that
you could free yourself from, but the reason sensuality is a problem is
because it requires that perversion of perception, it requires that
distortion, it requires wrong view, and implicit risk of commiting to
that which is circumstantial.

Imagine someone offers you a new car to drive for free, but informs you
that there might be a bomb rigged to it, it might explode. Would you
risk driving that car? You wouldn’t, because it doesn’t matter the
appeal of the object, you have the greater context/framework that there
is a bomb that could explode, you realise that you would be basing your
entire existence upon something entirely circumstantial and uncertain,
whereby if that thing changes you will not be able to remain unaffected
by it. By maintaining that context, it does not matter what you sense,
you will not have lust towards it because the danger is apparent. You
cannot have the context of the danger, the risk, the circumstantial
nature and at the same time enjoy the object of that. The only way to
enjoy it is to not see the risk. It’s mutually exclusive. And it’s not
like you must now try and not see things, because if you maintain the
right context, you will simply not seek sights out and if they do arise
you will not be overwhelmed, afraid or trying to avoid it either. In the
seen there will just be the seen, there will be no avoiding it or trying
to prolong it, because in the seen there is now no more perversion of
the context of the seen.

</div>

When you establish your being upon lust towards things, it defines you,
as I said, your ownership, things that you are committed to emotionally,
things you crave for, that is what defines you, that is what your sense
of self is. In the mind which is already perverted with lust, one
thinks: “‘I am’ is first”, and that’s the most fundamental distortion
that an ordinary person does, you think things are yours because you
think you are, but it’s actually the other way around, you are, you have
a sense of self, because you keep owning things gratuitously and you
keep owning them because you don’t see them as unstable, you don’t see
them as subject to change, so even when the change happens blatantly in
your face, you don’t see that as undermining your ownership, because you
assumed yourself to come first and independent. You just isolate these
examples when change goes against you and undermines your ownership and
sense of self and then try to cover that up by getting something new,
like possessions, and that’s why sensuality, a form of ownership and
consumption is the only way an ordinary person knows how to deal with
any emotional discomfort that he experiences, he doesn’t know how to
escape from painful feeling in any other way than turning towards
sensual feeling and trying to cover it up with new stuff. The fact is
that things could change against your will and fundamentally they cannot
be owned. By discerning that “subject to change” context, you will be
unable to not include yourself in it as well, you will start feeling it.
You start contemplating the vulnerable nature of your possessions and
sooner or later you will feel the pain of dukkha when you touch upon
something that is dear to you, then you start contemplating that as
perishable, and you can realise that you yourself are also subject to
that same perishing.

If you say, “Yes, the body is anicca”, unless you feel anxiety and fear
on account of that, you are not doing or seeing it correctly or you
might be an Arahant, but again then why would you be even listening to
these instructions. The point is that you, your sense of self is because
there is the taking things as ‘mine’ first, it’s because every single
time you engaged with the object of the senses you do so with ignorance,
without the right context, without maintaining the recognition that they
are vulnerable throughout the beginning, middle and end, it doesn’t
matter what point you engage with things, they remain in their nature,
at their core <span lang="pi">*anicca*</span>.

<div lang="en">

> “…When there is no you in connection with that, there is no you there.
> When there is no you there, you are neither here nor yonder nor
> between the two. This, just this, is the end of suffering…”

</div>

That’s basically just the proliferation of that self view because it
grows infinitely, so by being defined by objects of your senses, by
chasing the pleasure of these things, you become a being in the world of
these sense objects. That’s why a thought of sense restraint, a thought
of not chasing the sensual pleasure fills you with anxiety and terror.
You realise that it will kill you. That’s why even people who are not
into Practice, when they chase sensuality - to the point where basically
if they do not meet the required threshold of objects, they start
experiencing very painful mental states. Equally, if you are not able to
give in to that anxiety and be overwhelmed by it and refuse to engage
with the sense objects to the same extent, then you are diminishing that
gratuitously proliferated being in that world of sense objects, and you
can do so by maintaining the <span lang="pi">*anicca*</span> context of
things you want to engage with.

After the Buddha gives those instructions, Malunkaputta says:

<div lang="en">

> “I understand in detail what was stated briefly by the Blessed one.
> Having seen a sight, (Having heard a sound, smelled a smell, tasted a
> taste, touched a touch, known a phenomenon…) recollectedness is
> forgotten/confused(context is lost) when attending to the sign of the
> ‘beloved’. He experiences an impassioned mind and he keeps holding….”

</div>

Having seen a form without the context you would be confused, as in you
are already putting it first as opposed to second, not seeing the right
order. It means you are pulled by pleasure and as I said in the
beginning of this talk, the way to not be pulled by pleasure is not to
never see things but to never lose the context - the recognition of the
right order. If there is lust, that means that there is the absence of
context.

<div lang="en">

> “He experiences an impassioned mind and he keeps holding (assuming)….”

</div>

He is assuming it in the wrong order.

<div lang="en">

> “For him, with the arising of sights, various feelings increase. For
> him, the mind is spoiled by desire and irritation. Accumulating
> suffering in this way, Nibbana is said to be far away.”

</div>

Your mode of being becomes dependent upon the sights, etc. Which means
that now whatever else you start experiencing, like feelings, you are
just proliferating more and more. That’s why if sensuality is not kept
in check by circumstances limiting access to it, everybody would be an
addict, and most people are addicts one way or another. What I mean is
that it is not a static thing, where you can just enjoy sensuality and
then restrain yourself. No, each time you enjoy sensuality that means
next time you will need to enjoy more of it, your being grows towards
it. You become more dependent upon it. It’s not a static thing and
that’s the danger you have to recognise as well. People think “Ok, I
understand this so I will restrain later”, but later might be too late,
it might be too much. You only have a certain capacity to withdraw
yourself from it and if you overflow that being of sensuality, you will
not have means to get yourself out of it anymore. You became too
dependent.

<div lang="en">

> “…Accumulating suffering in this way, Nibbana is said to be far away…”

</div>

It builds up and then even when a person with all of that piled up on
him thinks about nibbana, he will think of it in terms of that pile up.
In other words, for him nibbana will be another sensual thing, the
greatest pleasure, the fulfilment of desire, which is just an extension
of everything else that he has been chasing so far.

What a puthujjana thinks death is, that is closer to nibbana than what
he thinks nibbana is, and that is why sometimes when the Buddha taught
nibbana to some people they were upset. Nibbana is the death of your
sense of self, your proliferated being upon sense objects. That’s why
the true practice, practically speaking, more often than not, will be
unpleasant for people certainly in the beginning, because it’s going to
be about undoing that sense of self, not finding that last missing piece
that will make you complete or help you abide in the ultimate joy of
bliss forever. No, it’s about undoing that whole stinky pile of sensual
rubbish. And the more of that pile you accumulate, the more work you
will have to do to clean it up.

Procrastination is carelessness and that will only accumulate suffering.
For example, many people who read the suttas recognise what needs to be
done, but keep absolving themselves from the sense of duty to do it,
waiting for the right conditions, and that procrastination is not a
static thing. For as long as it lasts, it will result in more things
that you have to clean up. If you could not make yourself clean your
room when it was barely cluttered, then because of that procrastinating,
you will have 100 times more things to clean up,…good luck starting
then.

<div lang="en">

> “He is not impassioned by sights (sounds,smells,tastes,touches, or

</div>

There is no craving being cultivated towards sense objects. He
prioritises the context not the content of his experience.
