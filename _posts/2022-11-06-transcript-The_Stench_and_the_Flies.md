**Ajahn Nyanamoli**: How should you address these “flies” of impure
thoughts? Is it more effective to deal with them one by one, using
methods of concentration, or try to deny them in some other way? Or, is
it better to eliminate the root causes to stop these thoughts from
recurring?

The key to abandoning them is by removing what attracts them in the
first place.

**Q**: The stench.

**Nm**: And you maintain that stench by acting out of craving, by not
being restrained, by not enduring things on the right level.

**Q**: If one keeps restraint and endures on the right level, can those
flies return?

**Nm**: The return of those unwholesome thoughts is not a random
occurrence; it results from losing control over one’s behavior and
allowing impurities to accumulate. This happens because of choices made
to act out of craving, succumb to sensual desires, abandon
sense-restraint, lose sight of broader perspectives, and yield to
distractions. Attempting to address these thoughts through concentration
practices or methods to stop thinking doesn’t address the root issue.
It’s akin to chasing the flies without addressing the source of the
problem.

Even if you lead a life of skillful management, you remain in the same
domain whereby those thoughts will keep arising. The key is not to focus
on or deny the symptoms like ill will or lustful thoughts but to address
their root cause. These thoughts persist because the mind frequently
dwells on themes that provoke them, such as the value of pleasure, the
justification of aversion, the sense of ownership, entitlement, etc.,
all of which contradict the universal nature of things. The solution
lies in not indulging in these themes and instead developing their
opposites.

**Q**: You can’t start the cleansing if you have that wrong view that it
is the flies that are making me stink.

**Nm**: Exactly, the flies are not the source of the stench; they are
merely its indicators. The presence of flies indicates that something is
there to attract them.

**Q**: If you can’t accept that, there is no hope in freeing yourself
from flies.

**Nm**: And you wouldn’t accept that because it’s just too much aversion
towards flies and desire for the stench.

**Q**: So one must understand the origin of the stench and acknowledge
that the flies are there because of it.

**Nm**: Yes, don’t perpetuate the idea of dealing with the flies
themselves but rather focus on recognizing that the presence of flies
signifies the simultaneous existence of what attracts them. Lustful
thoughts, for instance, cannot manifest unless there is a simultaneous
presence of a lustful state of mind fueled by longing for and value in
sensual pleasures.

The key is to discern this and understand what to look for and how to
address it. If all one does is justify dealing with the flies through
various management techniques and concentration methods, then these
insights will not be fruitful.

**Q**: Recognizing the source of the issue is close to having the right
view or at least – it’s a step in the right direction. i.e. the mundane
right view.

**Nm**: Yes, understanding the problem’s root is essential for
cultivating the right view. Without this insight, you can’t learn how to
endure things on the right level. Right endurance does not mean
tolerating the flies without action. Instead, it entails taking action
consisting of abandoning the pollution/stench. That is the Middle Way.

The root of suffering is craving, not external things, sensory
experiences, or thoughts. It’s the craving in response to what is felt
that is at the core of suffering, and this is something you carry with
you.

Understanding the right view begins with comprehending what suffering
truly is. When you recognize the presence of craving, you simultaneously
acknowledge the presence of suffering.

When you discern craving, and comprehend its signs and features, you
have the foundation of the right view. You’ve genuinely, correctly, and
accurately identified the cause of suffering. Consequently, you know
precisely how to escape it without needing further analysis.

Knowing the presence of craving reveals that the absence of craving
leads to the absence of suffering, regardless of external circumstances.

So, how can you develop the absence of craving? That’s where the Noble
Eightfold Path comes in. You might not necessarily see it in its
eight-fold structure as the Buddha described it, but you grasp its
fundamental principles. These include practicing sense restraint,
guarding your sense doors, refraining from acting out of craving and
abandoning the unnecessary aversion towards discomfort and the
unwarranted delight in comfort, which are forms of craving. You won’t
find craving as a tangible object you can witness with your senses; it’s
always in the background context, maintained through a careless attitude
towards pleasure—your default inclination. The true peril is not the
presence or absence of pleasure in the world but the tendency to lean
towards it and away from pain gratuitously.

**Q**: Leaning towards pleasure, is longing.

**Nm**: Leaning away from pain is aversion.

**Q**: That’s the stench and then the suffering is the flies.

**Nm**: That’s all the consequences of it. So if there is no leaning,
there would be no flies. If there is no leaning towards pleasure, there
would be no lustful thoughts. If there is no leaning away from pain,
i.e. aversion, or craving, there would be no angry thoughts, no thoughts
of ill will, or discontent. That’s what I mean, thoughts and hindrances
and everything else are the symptoms of the problem. The problem of your
craving.
