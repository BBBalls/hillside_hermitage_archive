## 202hh- Nibbana Is The Ultimate Uncertainty

***

Colloquially speaking, if something is determined it implies certainty
and undetermined implies uncertainty. The highest undetermined thing is
*Nibbana*, the phenomenon of *asankhata dhamma*. So from the point of
view of an ignorant *putthujjana\'s* mind which depends on certainty, on
*nicca*, on permanence, on taking things personally, *Nibbana* is the
ultimate uncertainty, the most frightening thing. However, uncertainty
is frightening only if you still take certainty for granted and 'put it
first' (i.e you see it in the wrong order, rather than seeing that
certainty is sought after only because of the basis of uncertainty which
is first), you think that things are nicca and only occasionally
*anicca* without realizing that they are always *anicca*.

Sometimes when people understood the Nibbana that the Buddha taught,
they would become distraught, overcome with fear, because for them, that
Nibbana meant death or that which would destroy them.

Alagaddūpama Sutta (MN 22):

> "Venerable sir, can there be agitation about what is non-existent
> internally?"
>
> "There can be, bhikkhu," the Blessed One said. "Here, bhikkhu, someone
> has the view: 'That which is the self is the world; after death I
> shall be permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change; I
> shall endure as long as eternity.' He hears the Tathāgata or a
> disciple of the Tathāgata teaching the Dhamma for the elimination of
> all standpoints, decisions, obsessions, adherences, and underlying
> tendencies, for the stilling of all determinations, for the
> relinquishing of all attachments, for the destruction of craving, for
> dispassion, for cessation, for Nibbāna. He thinks thus: 'So I shall be
> annihilated! So I shall perish! So I shall be no more!' Then he
> sorrows, grieves, and laments, he weeps beating his breast and becomes
> distraught. That is how there is agitation about what is non-existent
> internally."

Thus you have to train your mind so that the uncertainty of undetermined
Nibbana, the dispassion of Nibbana will be the highest bliss rather than
the foremost terror. You can do that by first cultivating virtue and
sense restraint, and then if you want a contemplation theme that will
approximate Nibbana, you can use the phenomenon of uncertainty. Examples
of such contemplations can be found in the suttas:

Udāna Sutta (SN 22:55), and in Āneñja-sappāya Sutta (MN 106):

> "It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it
> will not be mine. I am giving up what exists, what has come to be."

Maraṇassati Sutta (AN 6:19):

> "Therefore you should train yourselves: 'We will dwell heedfully. We
> will develop mindfulness of death acutely for the sake of ending the
> defilements.' That is how you should train yourselves."

The main characteristic of those contemplations is the recognition of
that fundamental context of your existence which is always 'uncertain'.
You don\'t have to fabricate that truth, you just need to find it and
remember it, and that\'s actually why you can sustain mindfulness on it
because it\'s always true.

### Uncertainty Is Always In The Background.

If you want to contemplate the phenomenon of *Nibbana* even as a
*puthujjana*, then contemplate uncertainty, as in, start feeling it,
contemplate that 'your self is fully caged within Uncertainty' (which is
the 'right order of appearance). The tendency for many people who try to
practice *anicca*, is that they try to determine the uncertainty in
things 'over there', which means you are then just determining that
which is undetermined. So when people go around saying that "everything
out there is impermanent", that is true, but that\'s not the *anicca*
which matters. *Anicca* that matters is on the level of your existence,
and if you understood it, you wouldn\'t be able to just say that your
body is *anicca* and still be equally as ignorant and passionate as
before. If you see that your body, your existence is uncertain, you will
feel the threat of that fact. That\'s why *sila* needs to be established
beforehand because most minds would not be able to bear the recognition
of what *Nibbana* is. If the mind is strong enough on account of virtue,
it will not get distraught in the face of that fundamental uncertain
nature.

Everyone can feel that uncertainty, however, for an untrained mind it
will feel like anxiety but for the trained mind that got used to it,
recognized, and understood uncertainty, such a mind will be at peace,
because the anxious aspect of uncertainty is due to ignorance of it.

### Enduring A Feeling Is Unavoidable

All you need to do is start practicing sense restraint and that will
enable you to 'endure feelings' which is not optional, the only optional
thing is HOW you endure it. From the start, your whole life is about
trying to get rid of or get hold of feelings, and you do all that based
on having to endure those feelings. But if you practice sense restraint
and endure it on those terms, you still have to endure it, but the
benefit is that it can result in wisdom. That\'s why the Buddha said:

Salayatana-vibhanga Sutta (MN 137):

> \" By depending & relying on the six kinds of renunciation joys,
> abandon & transcend the six kinds of household joys. Such is their
> abandoning, such is their transcending. By depending & relying on the
> six kinds of renunciation distress, abandon & transcend the six kinds
> of household distress. Such is their abandoning, such is their
> transcending. By depending & relying on the six kinds of renunciation
> equanimity, abandon & transcend the six kinds of household equanimity.
> Such is their abandoning, such their transcending.\"

You replace one type of feeling with another because feelings are not
optional. Whether it\'s the feeling of the householder or the
renunciant, a feeling will have to be there, you are subjected to it and
you will have to endure it. So that\'s why the WAY of endurance that you
choose is important. Will it be the way of welcoming, resisting,
denying, or the middle way, the way of not acting out of craving?

### The Undetermined Feeling

When one KNOWS a neutral feeling, it is then recognized as superior to a
pleasant feeling, because pleasure pressures you to get more and pain
pressures you to get rid of it. But with a neutral feeling, it is
undetermined. You are undetermined and not pressured in a neutral
feeling. The only problem with a neutral feeling is when you do NOT KNOW
it. It\'s your ignorance of the neutral feeling that then pressures you
toward distraction and delusion:

Cūḷa Vedalla Sutta (MN 44):

> "Pleasant feeling is pleasant when it remains and painful when it
> perishes. Painful feeling is painful when it remains and pleasant when
> it perishes. *Neutral feeling is pleasant when known, and painful when
> not-known.*"

If you want to know and benefit from the neutral feeling you have to
start restraining the delight in pleasure and stop trying to get rid of
the pain by default. When you see the value in the neutral, you will see
the value in uncertainty, in neither agreeable-or-disagreeable, the
value in non-disturbance, the value in dispassion, in disenchantment,
which most people do not see. For most people, passion is seen as good,
it provides you with the drive for life, and that\'s true, that\'s the
householder\'s joy, but to have that joy you must also be blind to the
implicit danger in that thing that you are passionate about, because if
you become aware of the danger, then you will realize that it's not
worth clinging to or valuing, so then letting go is not a choice. When
you realize that your passion is a trap, you automatically don\'t want
it. The only time you get trapped by a trap is when you don\'t see it as
a trap.

So contemplate being within uncertainty not as an object of your
attention but as the background of your experience as a whole. Start
seeing the characteristics of uncertainty, and if you develop in that
way, you will force your mind to become dispassionate, and that\'s when
the mind starts seeing clearly when the clouds of passion disappear.

### The Context Of The Uncertain Body

*Sabbe Sankhara Anicca*- all determinations are uncertain. If
determinations are uncertain then what is to be said about the things
that the determinations determine. They are even more uncertain. So,
*sabbe SANKHARA anicca, sabbe SANKHARA dukkha*, all determinations are
uncertain and unsatisfactory, thus sabbe DHAMMA anatta - everything that
is determined cannot be owned.

Practically speaking, determinations (*sankhara*) are things that are
the basis for your ownership. For example, let\'s say you are attached
to your house and family, the joy that you get on account of those
things is determined by having the house and family. You can then say,
if you are attached to your family, the presence of both yours and their
bodies are now the basis for the entire emotional relationship that you
have with your family, all the joys and griefs. Those emotional
experiences would not be there if the body was not there, so the
fundamental determination is the body. That\'s why if one maintains the
context of the body as the necessary basis for any experience in your
life, with the recognition of Uncertainty of that determination/ that
context, then whatever you experience based on that uncertain, unstable
bodily context, is unownable. So your family will still be there and
perceived but now the emotional basis for your ownership is gone because
it\'s seen based on uncertainty.

It takes a lot of training to develop that level of clarity regarding
the context of the body as a determination for everything. Most people
wouldn\'t see that connection, they wouldn\'t see that the presently
enduring body is that which determines all of their emotional joys and
griefs that they get from some event in the world. If a person sees that
the main characteristic of their body is uncertainty then it doesn\'t
matter what comes their way, they wouldn\'t get emotionally upset
because they cannot forget the container of uncertainty in which this is
all happening. A great example of this is found in:

Nandamātar Sutta (AN 7.50):

> "I don't have only that amazing & astounding quality, venerable sir. I
> have another amazing & astounding quality. I had an only son: Nanda,
> dear & appealing. The rulers seized & abducted him on some pretext and
> had him executed. But when the boy had been arrested or was being
> arrested, when he had been imprisoned or was being imprisoned, when he
> had been killed or was being killed, I don\'t recall any alteration of
> my mind."
>
> "It's amazing, Nandamātar! It's astounding, that you can purify even
> as little as the arising of a thought."

The mind that is established upon the undetermined, upon the uncertain
as the fundamental non-negotiable basis, the Nibbana, will not resist
the uncertainty because doing so is still within the uncertainty.

Your sense of self needs to have these determinations that you blindly
take ownership of. The point to consider here, it\'s not about throwing
away your possessions, but instead find things that you do own and
through that sense of ownership start discerning the uncertainty of that
thing. Initially, that will be felt anxiously, but once the mind is
developed you will not suffer much on account of that anxiety, however,
it\'s still the same route that you have to go down if you want to
develop Nibbana.

### The One And Only Path

Vitthara Sutta (AN 4.162):

> "Monks, there are these four modes of practice. Which four? Painful
> practice with slow understanding, painful practice with quick
> understanding, pleasant practice with slow understanding, & pleasant
> practice with quick understanding.."

Either way, it\'s the same path that needs to be walked, through the
sense of ownership which is present you need to discern the uncertainty,
and the mind which has developed samadhi will not be moved by that
uncertainty, relatively speaking. Samadhi is not measured by how
peaceful or blissful your meditation session was until the bell rang,
it\'s measured by how much you don't move in the face of uncertainty,
sensuality, pain, misfortune, etc. How much is your mind scraping at the
walls to outrun the pain, or how much is it like a mountain that cannot
be moved? Being immovable is *samadhi*. The beginning of the right
*samadhi* is not being moved by the five hindrances or by the joys and
griefs regarding the world. If you develop that, it\'s the *samadhi* of
*jhana*.

Most people hope that if they do some technique of watching the breath
and so on, they will get into *jhana* and then they will not be bothered
by the hindrances or moved by the joys and griefs of the world, but as
you can see, you have to do the work of not moving on account of the
joys, griefs, and hindrances first and then the result will be the
pleasure of the seclusion, which is where *jhana* is. The measure of
samadhi is the immovability regarding any pressure whether positive or
negative, but it\'s usually negative.

If you have no sila, you have no samadhi and will be completely
overwhelmed if you understand what *Nibbana* is. The Buddha\'s teaching
will terrify you, because from the *putthajjanas* point of view, "it is
the death of me" and it is. If you invest the effort in sila, through
such endurance you will be developing *samadhi*.

The necessary *samadhi* will be born from the work of your sila, sense
restraint, abandoning the joys and griefs, and your cultivation of the
context of uncertainty. In that way, you will force your mind to
compose, which will have to result in clear seeing.

## 203hh- The Truth About The Five Hindrances

[[source pdf]](/hillside_hermitage_archive/source_pdfs/20210330 - 202hh - Nibbana is the ultimate uncertainty.pdf){:target="blank"} [[external link]](https://t.me/HillsideHermitage/74){:target="blank"}

***

> "Monks, there are these five hindrances. Which five? Sensual desire as
> a hindrance, ill will as a hindrance, sloth & drowsiness as a
> hindrance, restlessness & anxiety as a hindrance, and doubt as a
> hindrance. These are the five hindrances."

> -- AN 9.64

The first thing to do is to clear up what the hindrances are not. They
are not things that arise occasionally in you and they are not only
present when your mind is attending to them. Hindrances in themselves
are on the level of your currently enduring existence as a whole, as a
basis for your world.

Only when samadhi is developed to the extent of jhana, has the mind
overcome hindrances, everything else in your day to day life, even if
you are not necessarily gripped by particular manifestations of lust,
anger, and confusion, are still within the domain of the hindrances.
They are on the level of your existential situation, and by that, I mean
that at any given time you are either lustful or liable to lust, either
irritable or liable to irritation, and so on. In other words, it\'s not
like there are these five separate hindrances, rather, fundamentally you
are within the domain of hindrances which is one thing. In the same
sense, there are the five aggregates and then on account of the five
aggregates as a whole, you can discern each of them. The same principle
applies to the five hindrances which are the basis of an undeveloped,
unenlightened mind. That base is exemplified and manifested through one
example at a time or the liability through one of them at a time.
That\'s why surmounting the hindrances equals surmounting the world.

The first jhana is like surmounting the entire existential situation
whereby now you are withdrawn and safe from lust and liability to lust
and so on. This is important because as long as people think that
hindrances are these things that come and go, then all you need to do to
deal with them is to just manage the unwholesome state while it's there,
but if you start understanding that the hindrances are on the level of
"my situation already as it is, even if I do not discern any specific
hindrance, I am already within the hindrances", then that will force you
to broaden your context more and more until you reach that supreme
safety from hindrances which is the first jhana. Not because the
hindrances don\'t arise, the Buddha doesn\'t mean that joys and griefs
don\'t arise in the world. No, he meant that you surmount those things
which are there, the domain of joy, grief, and five hindrances are there
but you have surmounted them. Just because you don\'t have any issues
currently arising doesn\'t mean that you are entering the jhana, No,
that\'s still well in the domain of the hindrances.

### Liability To Being Hindered 

One way to surmount the domain of the hindrances would be to reflect:
"Is there arisen lust in me or can non-arisen lust arise?". You have to
include that liability to lust as a hindrance already because you might
not have any arisen lust now but since you are liable to lust arising,
that means the hindrance is present. It\'s foolish to think that just
because it\'s not presently active, that you are free from lust. If you
are liable then you are not free. The liability is part of the
hindrance.

Even if you are not sure whether you are liable to lust, that means that
the hindrance of doubt or lack of clarity is there. If you have
abandoned lust, you will be clear about it. If you are liable to one
hindrance you are liable to them all. There are five hindrances, not
three and a half or two, it\'s always the five different ways that you
can be hindered.

If you start thinking of them, not as individual things that
occasionally arise but start seeing that your world is within them, even
your sense restraint and "dhamma practice" is within the five
hindrances. The only time you won\'t be within them is in the first
jhana, that is why the one who surmounts them abides in the joy of
seclusion from unwholesome states.

At Venāgapura, AN 3.63:

> "\...But, Master Gotama, what is the celestial high and luxurious bed
> that at present you gain at will, without trouble or difficulty?"
>
> \"Here, brahmin, when I am dwelling in dependence on a village or
> town, in the morning I dress, take my bowl and robe, and enter that
> village or town for alms. After the meal, when I have returned from
> the alms round, I enter a grove. I collect some grass or leaves that I
> find there into a pile and then sit down. Having folded my legs
> crosswise and straightened my body, I bring mindfulness to the fore.
> Then, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome
> states, I enter and dwell in the first jhāna,\...
>
> "Then, brahmin, when I am in such a state, if I walk back and forth,
> on that occasion my walking back and forth is celestial. If I am
> standing, on that occasion my standing is celestial. If I am sitting,
> on that occasion my sitting is celestial. If I lie down, on that
> occasion this is my celestial high and luxurious bed. This is that
> celestial high and luxurious bed that at present I can gain at will,
> without trouble or difficulty."

### The Five Hindrances Are One In Unwholesomeness. 

The first step to getting secluded is to see the hindrances for what
they are, not just managing occasional flurries of worry, irritation,
lustful thoughts, and so on. No, you need to see that all of that is
happening within the context of the five hindrances. Liability to them
means that they are there, otherwise, you wouldn\'t be liable to them.
If you start thinking like that and depending on how much effort you
make you will get to see that you are not responsible for the hindrances
arising but you are responsible for them hindering you. You are the one
that takes them up ignorantly, but that is not on the level of a choice,
as in you cannot just choose not to take up the hindrances, it's more
like, sometimes you choose to do something that results in you being
unable to not take them. So if you stop thinking of them individually
but see them as one then it doesn\'t matter what hindrance is there,
your attitude towards any hindrance is what you start to concern
yourself with, instead of trying to manage hindrance through asubha or
metta and so on.

It doesn\'t matter which hindrance it is, an unwholesome state is
present, so what is your attitude towards that? In that way, you can
practice freedom from the hindrances by practicing the discernment of
your liability to the unwholesome.

That\'s what all hindrances have in common, they are all unwholesome. So
why are you liable to unwholesome states? The answer is quite simple,
it\'s because some of those states you don\'t see as unwholesome and you
willingly delight, entertain, welcome, and act out of them. That\'s the
gateway we speak about, that you willingly turn a blind eye to. To the
extent, you can ignore the gateway to that extent the hindrances will
find a way to get in.

### The Chief Hindrance And The Foremost Danger. 

What is the chief hindrance on account of which people let the other
four hindrances in? It's sensuality, and not seeing the danger in
sensuality is not seeing the danger based on the five hindrances, and
because of that, when a hindrance comes that you don\'t want, you will
not be able to not be involved because your core practice up to that
point was to be involved with the hindrances by choice, through
welcoming sensuality in your thoughts (opening the gate), delighting in
it and above all not seeing the danger. That\'s also where the crux of
that recognition of danger is, in other words, the danger in sensuality
is not that later on things will not work out or things will be too much
to manage and thus sensuality is not good. No, even before you engage in
sensuality, the danger is in not seeing the danger in your welcoming of
sensuality which brings with it the liability to the other four
hindrances. Through willingly entertaining sensuality you are willingly
accepting anxiety, worry, fear, dullness, depression, confusion, and
everything else that comes with it. If the danger of that can become
apparent, you will see that even the prospect of sensuality is
dangerous.(In other words, there are drawbacks of sensuality but that
which makes you liable to the drawbacks is your desire and lust, which
is the main danger.)

Magandiya Sutta, MN 75:

> \"Magandiya, suppose that there was a leper covered with sores and
> infections, devoured by worms, picking the scabs off the openings of
> his wounds with his nails, cauterizing his body over a pit of glowing
> embers. His friends, companions, & relatives would take him to a
> doctor. The doctor would concoct medicine for him, and thanks to the
> medicine he would be cured of his leprosy: well & happy, free, master
> of himself, going wherever he liked. Then suppose two strong men,
> having grabbed him with their arms, were to drag him to a pit of
> glowing embers. What do you think? Wouldn\'t he twist his body this
> way & that?\"
>
> \"Yes, Master Gotama. Why is that? The fire is painful to the touch,
> very hot & scorching.\"
>
> \"Now what do you think, Magandiya? Is the fire painful to the touch,
> very hot & scorching, only now, or was it also that way before?\"
>
> \"Both now & before is it painful to the touch, very hot & scorching,
> master Gotama. It\'s just that when the man was a leper covered with
> sores and infections, devoured by worms, picking the scabs off the
> openings of his wounds with his nails, his faculties were impaired,
> which was why, even though the fire was actually painful to the touch,
> he had the skewed perception of \'pleasant.\'\"
>
> \"In the same way, Magandiya, sensual pleasures in the past were
> painful to the touch, very hot & scorching; sensual pleasures in the
> future will be painful to the touch, very hot & scorching; sensual
> pleasures at present are painful to the touch, very hot & scorching;
> but when beings are not free from passion for sensual pleasures ---
> devoured by sensual craving, burning with sensual fever --- their
> faculties are impaired, which is why, even though sensual pleasures
> are actually painful to the touch, they have the skewed perception of
> \'pleasant...\"

By seeing the connection between welcoming sensuality and the implicit
weight of the danger(drawbacks) that is hidden in that welcoming, you
will then realize that no amount of sensuality is worth accepting for
that risk, and therefore the danger becomes apparent.

Theragatha, 5.1 Rāja­datta:

> "I, a monk, went to a charnel ground, And saw a woman left there,\
> Discarded in a cemetery, Full of worms that devoured her.\
> Some men were disgusted, Seeing her dead and rotten;\
> But sexual desire arose in me, I was as if blind to her oozing body.\
> Quicker than the boiling of rice, I left that place,\
> Mindful and aware, I sat down to one side.\
> Then the realization, Came upon me---\
> *The danger became apparent*, And I was firmly repulsed.\
> Then my mind was liberated--- See the excellence of the Dhamma!\
> I've attained the three knowledges, And fulfilled the Buddha's
> instructions."

People do not see the connection between the perils that they are
exposed to and the entrance for those perils being their acceptance of
sensuality, because if they do see the connection, then that great
danger will become apparent. The only reason a person keeps engaging in
sensuality is that they do not see the danger of it.

### It\'s Entirely Up To You. 

Mahā Assapura Sutta , MN 39:

> "\...when these five hindrances are unabandoned in himself, a bhikkhu
> sees them respectively as a debt, a disease, a prison, slavery, and a
> road across a desert. But when these five hindrances have been
> abandoned in himself, he sees that as freedom from debt, health,
> release from prison, freedom from slavery, and a land of
> safety."Having abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the
> mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
> secluded from unwholesome states, he enters upon and abides in the
> first jhāna,..\"

That sense of safety and relief does not come from 'nobody knocking on
your door and threatening you'(the absence of a hindrance), it comes
from not welcoming sensuality through which no liability of other
hindrances can apply to you, and the reason why this is so great and
wholesome is because it\'s entirely up to you. Welcoming sensuality or
not doesn\'t depend on the circumstances, you can always say no to
welcoming sensuality on the level of your thoughts (the gateway). What
is your attitude when the thought of sensuality arises? Do you see it as
agreeable, friendly, dear to you, not dangerous and entertaining or do
you see it as "this is the entrance" for eons of suffering (the
welcoming of sensuality)?

Practically speaking, the other four hindrances will torment you sooner
or later, all because you don\'t see the danger in sensuality, you
don\'t see the bait as the bait, you don\'t see the hook inside.

For the uprooting of the domain of the five hindrances, you need to see
the implicit danger waiting before you even engage, not while you\'re
engaging or afterward when you feel bad.

Sammasa Sutta, SN 12.66:

> "\...Whatever ascetics and brahmins at present regard that in the
> world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as permanent, as happiness,
> as self, as healthy, as secure: they are nurturing craving. In
> nurturing craving they are nurturing acquisition. In nurturing
> acquisition they are nurturing suffering. In nurturing suffering they
> are not freed from birth, aging, and death; they are not freed from
> sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; they are not
> freed from suffering, I say."
>
> "Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a bronze cup of a beverage having a fine
> color, aroma, and taste, but it was mixed with poison. Then a man
> would come along, oppressed and afflicted by the heat, tired, parched,
> and thirsty. They would tell him: 'Good man, this beverage in the
> bronze cup has a fine color, aroma, and taste, but it is mixed with
> poison. Drink it if you wish. If you drink it, it will gratify you
> with its color, aroma, and taste, but by drinking it you will meet
> death or deadly suffering.' Suddenly, without reflecting, he would
> drink the beverage---he would not reject it---and thereby he would
> meet death or deadly suffering."
>
> "So too, bhikkhus, whatever ascetics and brahmins in the past ... in
> the future \... at present regard that in the world with a pleasant
> and agreeable nature as permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy,
> as secure: they are nurturing craving. In nurturing craving \... they
> are not freed from suffering, I say..."

When you have thoughts of sensuality you need to start seeing them as
bait and then that\'s how you will become unable to welcome it. You
cannot just choose to not welcome sensuality, that\'s impossible, but if
you contemplate the danger in it then you realize that your welcoming
will start to fade because the only reason why you used to welcome it,
is because you never saw what it implies, you never saw its full
significance right there and then, not later. When the danger becomes
apparent, you will understand the extent of gratification, and then you
will understand the extent of escape. You will know that if you keep
contemplating the danger, you will know that the gratification which is
your welcoming and delight in the prospect of sensuality, will fade and
that will be the full escape from this.

Don\'t confuse the not seeing of sensual thought with not having sensual
thoughts, that\'s not the same thing. You will have thoughts towards
sensuality and that\'s where you see the peril, but that doesn\'t mean
that you have no thoughts of sensuality arising or that the significance
of sensual joy has disappeared. No, that stays, that\'s why, you
surmount it, not prevent it from arising. If you have surmounted it for
a long period, it will eventually stop arising on its own, not because
you stopped it.

Seeing the danger in 'delighting in the prospect of pleasure', that
insight is not painful, it\'s neutral. Getting pleasure or not is on the
level of pain, but seeing the danger before you engage in pleasure is
not painful, it\'s eye-opening.

### The Right Perspective Regarding The Body.

Can you have restraint of the six senses without the right context or
perspective? No, because lack of perspective means that you are already
pulled down with the senses, that\'s why the Buddha called sensuality
(and the other hindrances) that which weakens wisdom, that which weakens
perspective. When you get pulled down the pathway of the wild animal,
you cannot sustain perspective. You either go down the hole or you
sustain the perspective. I mention perspective is because usually when a
person tries to do mindfulness of the body, they think it\'s about
'feeling the body', but actually 'mindfulness of the body' is the
fundamental perspective regarding your world, the perspective on the
presence of the 'body-there', as satipathana sutta says.

The 'body-there' is the basis for these six senses/animals. You can\'t
have a sense organ without the unit of the body on which it is based on.
That\'s why mindfulness of the body is the perspective regarding all the
six animals/senses. It\'s not some physical method or practice of trying
to 'stay in the body', it\'s rather on the level of knowledge of the
body-there, knowing its nature, it\'s the 'post', from which these
senses want to pull left and right.

If you contemplate the nature of that body, as something which is
unownable, subject to death and so on, then no pleasures within the
container of the body will be able to overwhelm that perspective if
it\'s thoroughly developed. It\'s easy to say that this body is
'not-mine', but you need to see it on the right level. If you think that
you are seeing the body on the right level of 'not-mine', then
contemplate whether you have any passion or liability to passion(same
with other defilements) in your mind. If the answer is yes then that\'s
not the right level, because seeing the body on the right level is
impenetrable to passion, aversion, and delusion. So if you, with a mind
which is not above those things thinks that you are doing mindfulness of
the body, you will not make the right effort to find out what the right
level of mindfulness of the body is, the level which is not liable to
the defilements.

When you hear about mindfulness of the body, you get an idea of it, but
instead of focusing on 'doing' that mindfulness, focus on
'understanding' the idea of what mindfulness of the body is. Most people
will take their initial idea for granted. They hear the teaching on
mindfulness of the body and whatever comes to their mind that is what
they do, convinced that they have understood mindfulness of the body
right away. That would be very fortunate if that was true. Of course,
you have to start having some idea but you must not take that initial
notion for granted but instead keep clarifying that notion further:
\"Does my idea correspond to what the suttas describe? Does it make me
completely dispassionate even when I am not practicing some kind of
'moment to moment focus on the body'? Is my mindful perspective an
anchor which allows me to move around dispassionately and not liable to
anger or distraction? Or is it something that when I focus on the body
there are no defilements present but when I stop, the defilements slowly
return? (If that is the case, that\'s not mindfulness, that\'s you just
replacing one object with another)

Your idea must be upgraded, you must develop understanding, not just go
with whatever you assume mindfulness of the body to be. If that
mindfulness that you assumed was correct, you would have no more sensual
pull. If you understand the mindfulness of the body, you will be
enlightened. So don\'t conflate fulfillment of understanding of
body-mindfulness with doing whatever you assume body-mindfulness is. So
ask yourself: \" What are the results of the body-mindfulness that you
have been doing? What are the results even when you are not doing that
mindfulness?\". You might not have any passions while you are focusing
on your particular practice, but what happens when you stop? Are you
still liable to passion? Because if there was any understanding
developed, it would remain even when you are not focussing on the body.

### Identifying With The Senses.

Regarding sense restraint, the problem is not that the senses/animals
want to go and feed in these different domains, the problem is that you
don\'t know how not to identify with them. In other words, you don\'t
know how not to take them as "mine". When the eye wants to see
something, when the ear wants to hear something and so on, your first
starting point is "I want to see something, I want to hear something..."
and then you hammer down restraint on yourself and that\'s why restraint
is unpleasant because there is a discrepancy there. That\'s why I say
that you shouldn\'t be trying to get rid of these things, you should
restrain yourself but you should only do this on the basis of allowing
these things to endure.

Your eyes want to see something, so you restrain your eyes from seeing
but you don\'t ignore the fact that EYES want to see something that\'s
unwholesome. That\'s how you get to outline the domain of the eye, you
realise: \"This is what an eye does\'\'. You don\'t want to be
strangling the eye, but you will do so because you are identified with
it and that kind of self-destruction is the only way out that you can
see, but it\'s not the middle way.

The simile is of six animals, and you are the one that should be in
charge of them, not being pulled around by them. The reason you are
pulled is because you cannot stop identifying with them. When they pull,
you feel like you are being pulled in that direction, and that\'s how
you start. So you begin by not giving in to the pull, but if all you do
is try to get rid of the pull, you are trying to remove the senses,
trying to kill the animals, which still doesn\'t make you in charge, it
just kills the animals.

You don\'t need all the animals to pull you, it\'s enough for just one
to pull you and for as long as you are alive you will have at least one
sense, at least your mind, even if all the other senses fail, you can
still have the mind which pulls you. So the point is that you must not
be pulled by those senses through your identification with them, not to
not have the senses pulling. When I say "non-identification" it should
not be understood as a matter of choice, as though you simply choose to
non-identify. No, by not being able to endure the pull, by not having
the clear context or perspective regarding the senses, you are
automatically identified, so you can\'t just choose to say "this is not
mine" but you can set yourself up so that you are unable to take it as
"mine", and you set yourself up by sustaining the perspective regarding
the various pulling senses. By contrasting the senses against the
better, the more wholesome broader perspective that corresponds to the
universal characteristics of the senses, and then you will get to see
that the senses are truly wild animals. You can then see that you have a
choice, to either let them run wild and then you will have to pay the
price for that or indirectly know that if you allow your sense to go
out, it could experience something which will result in its increased
excitement and agitation, which then you will have to deal with, so
it\'s better to restrain that sense so that you can abide in
non-agitation, as opposed to having to spend a lot of effort having to
calm the animal down and so on.

MN 19:

> "\...Just as in the last month of the rainy season, in the autumn,
> when the crops thicken, a cowherd would guard his cows by constantly
> tapping and poking them on this side and that with a stick to check
> and curb them. Why is that? Because he sees that he could be flogged,
> imprisoned, fined, or blamed if he let them stray into the crops. So
> too I saw in unwholesome states danger, degradation, and defilement,
> and in wholesome states the blessing of renunciation, the aspect of
> cleansing..."

All you need to do is prevent it from getting excited in the first
place, and the more you do that, the more you maintain that perspective
regardless of what sense is pulling you, the clearer the relationship
with the senses becomes. In other words, less and less identified with
them you will be. The senses will remain as they are, but the point of
view will be different, in the same way, that you see a dog, a bird,
another person and now there is just this creature here (your body)
which is always paired with you (closest to you) so to speak. This
creature here (the body) is just the one that is closest to your point
of view but still equally not yours. We usually regard this creature as
our own, as our closest friend, but you should regard it as a stranger
that doesn\'t necessarily mean you well. The creature is there, you are
paired with the senses and you have no choice about that, but you have a
choice whether they get agitated or not, or whether you will have to be
dealing with that or not. That\'s why there is the instruction to "guard
the sense doors" and not to chase down the sense objects so that you can
try to get rid of them or destroy or shut down the senses. You guard the
sense doors so that you will be able to see what is approaching before
it arrives so that you won\'t have to deal with the agitations resulting
from unwholesome engagements.

Sometimes you will fail at preventing the animals from getting excited
on account of your carelessness, but still, it\'s better to not give in
to them but instead restrains them forcefully, as the Buddha would say
"crush mind with mind":

MN 20:

> "\...If, while he is giving attention to stilling the thought-sankhara
> of those thoughts, there still arise in him evil unwholesome thoughts
> connected with desire, with hate, and with delusion, then, with his
> teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth,
> he should beat down, constrain, and crush mind with mind. When, with
> his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his
> mouth, he beats down, constrains, and crushes mind with mind, then any
> evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, with hate, and with
> delusion are abandoned in him and subside. With the abandoning of
> them, his mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, brought to
> singleness, and concentrated. Just as a strong man might seize a
> weaker man by the head or shoulders and beat him down, constrain him,
> and crush him, so too...when, with his teeth clenched and his tongue
> pressed against the roof of his mouth, a bhikkhu beats down,
> constrains, and *crushes mind with mind*...his mind becomes steadied
> internally, quieted, *brought to singleness*, and composed..."

The more you practice that restraint, the clearer the danger of allowing
the animals to run wild becomes. If all you are used to is being dragged
around by the leashes of various animals, you never see the danger
because you are constantly moving. By choosing the singleness of saying
"No" as opposed to the diversity of spreading in every direction, the
mind will become composed.

Usually, people think that singleness of mind will come at the end of
their proliferation into the diversity of sense experience, where all
proliferation ceases. No, singleness is when you undo all the
proliferation and find a point BEFORE things proliferate and then you
choose to stay on that level and protect it, you guard the doorway, that
one entrance, that\'s one-pointedness.

If the senses are used to running wild, they will be pulling a lot in
the beginning, that\'s what an untrained animal does but if you can
maintain the right perspective regarding this creature, you will tame
its senses and abide in jhana.

**Nm:** When it says "be restrained by the patimokkha", we can boil that
down to the eight or ten precepts and exclude the other rules which were
pertaining to social circumstances at the time, so it\'s not just for
monastics, even if you do not wear robes, if you want to practice then
the rules of patimokkha apply to you, not technically but in the spirit
of the eight precepts. That\'s why when the Buddha would speak about
virtue in the context outside of the monastic sangha, he would speak
about the eight precepts, which is the bare minimum for the beginning of
that self-taming restraint. The five precepts keep you from behaving
like an animal and you make merit which will contribute to a better
birth and so on. But if you are the one who sees himself as one who
practices the Dhamma, then you know that the eight precepts are not
negotiable, that is the bare minimum. So you can substitute the sentence
"come bhikkhu\..." with \" if you want to practice, ok, come here/follow
me, this is the discipline that you must take on, and once you have
taken it on, you need to start seeing the danger in the slightest
fault.\"

Now that can initially be taken neurotically, but that\'s ok, you will
get used to the neurotic aspect of it, but still remain seeing the value
of the discipline and the fear of breaking it. So in a way, if you are
neurotic about breaking the precepts, that fear will actually protect
your discipline. You are afraid of it because you know that it will undo
your striving. Things that you want to develop through your practice can
only be developed on the basis of discipline, so by reflecting on that
danger you will be afraid of doing it and that\'s why you won\'t be
careless about it. If you are not afraid about breaking the precepts,
that\'s when you become careless because there is no fear of wrongdoing
motivating you.

The common misconception, even with people who keep the precepts, who
see the direct value of it, they don\'t see how it is helping them to
tame themselves, they then keep the precepts out of faith, culture,
tradition or whatever meditation group they are a part of, they might
keep the rules on account of external circumstances motivating them to
be restrained, but deep down they still hold a view that all these
random things they do will somehow magically contribute to an experience
of a jhana or enlightenment which will mean that they have no more work
to do. In other words they don\'t see a direct link between what they
can do through their own choices and development of the right context
which will inevitably have to result in jhana and enlightenment, they
just do RANDOM work which they HOPE will produce the experience of jhana
or enlightenment.

The second part of the gradual training is guarding the senses. That\'s
what peripheral awareness is, the non-grasping of signs and features of
that which is seen (etc), it\'s not like you don\'t see anything. The
signs and features of a sense object that you experience are always
peripheral, you don\'t see signs and features. For example when you look
at a sign which says "Stop", you see the letters, the color and shape,
but the significance of "You must not pass beyond this point, you must
stop there", that is not in the sign, yet you experience that when your
eyes see the sign, those are the features of that sign, the significance
of it. The reason I'm saying this, is because often that practice of
sense restraint is conflated with a view that one must beat the senses
down, by not looking, not hearing and so on, but even if you do that,
you still won\'t see the significance of that, the signs and features of
what you\'re doing, and that\'s where you need to start recognising the
sense restraint to be.

When you are restraining/taming the senses you know before you do any
action whether that act will be rooted in greed, aversion or
distraction. But now let\'s say things surprise you, a sensual option
arises and pressures you, then you have a choice to dwell mentally on
the signs and features that are suitable for the increasing of passion
or dispassion, both things are there, you must choose to attend to
either one. Either way, pressure has arisen and you cannot undo that,
you have seen something. You realize that you are only relatively in
control of the senses, you can try avoid certain sights but still things
can happen because the organs are still there untamed and when that does
happen, you need to allow things to endure without breaking the
discipline, that\'s the order and that\'s why you have the discipline
first.

If you were to be restraining your senses correctly, it\'s effortless.
You don\'t need to be beating your eye down, cutting your ears off, etc,
so that you never experience objects that might cause the pressure of
lust or disagreeability to arise in you. All you need to do is to make
sure that when your eyes do see, or when your ears do hear, you don\'t
delight, accept, welcome, entertain the signs and features that are
making lust increase, like the sign of beauty, the sign of
non-agreeability, the sign of non-danger, the sign of friendly and
non-threatening, all those significances are the signs of sensuality. If
people were to truly see the danger of sensuality, none of that would
ever again be seen as safe, friendly, suitable, pleasurable for me, it
would be seen like a pit of burning embers, a poisonous drink, etc.
Those significances are there, it\'s not like you must remove the
significances of pleasures, no, you must stop entertaining them and look
for the other significances that are equally there that you have been
ignoring out of your habits of welcoming lust.

**Q:** I can attend to the beautiful significance of an object which
will increase lust or I can look at non-beautiful significance
(asubhanimitta) which would calm things down.

**Nm:** But not for the sake of getting rid of the beautiful parts or
for the sake of getting rid of the pressure, those things are not yours.
Your eye is pressured, and your eye wants the beautiful parts. All you
need to do is keep protecting the context of the non-beautiful, the
threatening and dangerous and keep it there, and it will prevail because
it is the fundamental context. That\'s why the Buddha would say, in
beauty, if you develop your mind, you will be able to see the ugly
through it. Not change the beautiful and the ugly, it\'s still the same
beautiful significances, but through them you see the ugly, you see the
danger.

> -- MN 152

**Q:** Do not grasp the sign of beauty...

**Nm:** Don\'t take it up, dont welcome it or entertain it. It\'s there
but you don\'t take it up, and you won\'t take it up, if you start
attending to the significances that you do not want to take up, the
significances of danger.

**Q:** So in a way, you should grasp the sign of danger?

**Nm:** Yes, you don\'t start in a neutral sense, you don\'t start your
practice whereby you have this equal choice of beautiful and ugly, you
begin by being fully gripped and pressured by the beautiful. Your sense
restraint begins by not doing that, so don\'t grasp those features and
then the other features will become more apparent and then by all means
grasp the feature of ugly, stick to it and it will develop dispassion
all the way to final liberation. Those beneficial features are not
visible because of the automatic grasp of lust - when you are touched by
pleasure, the automatic grasp at getting rid of the discomfort - when
you are touched by pain and the automatic grasp of distraction - when
you are touched by neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. You guard your
senses by maintaining the context that will make you abstain from
habitually grasping onto the beautiful aspects of what is given, and
that pertains to any given sense.

You only need to abandon things which are underlied by lust, aversion
and delusion, don\'t grasp at them, and the signs and features which are
revealed through non-grasping, you cannot grasp them in the same way,
means you cannot delight or lust after jhana, and that\'s exactly how
you enter jhana by fully withdrawing yourself from signs and features
that are grasped with lust, for increasing of lust, ill will or
ignorance. By all means grasp the sign of ugly but you cannot grasp it
with lust, you can only grasp it with discernment. It is worth keeping
in your mind because it results in dispassion.

**Q:**

> "When the monk is one who is guarded in the doors of his sense

> not create new feelings (from overeating). Thus I will maintain
> myself, be blameless, & live in comfort.\"

**Nm:** You need to then sustain the right motivation for eating, it\'s
not optional. Don\'t think that by eating half a meal it constitutes
being moderate, that\'s basically asceticism and it\'s often misguided.
You should be moderate in eating, not losing the context for eating. How
is that done? By not eating for the wrong reasons and eating for the
right reasons, and that motivation is something that you can choose to
keep in your mind or ignore. If you can keep that motivation in mind,
you don\'t have to worry about overeating or under-eating. Often
moderation of eating gets conflated with some idea like: \"I eat only
20% of my meal\'\', but that just means that you are still ignorant of
the motivation behind your eating. Just because you reduce your
enjoyment in eating to 20%, does not mean that your sensuality is not
there. If there is any form of passion in regard to food that means you
are not eating for the right reasons, which means you need to be
contemplating and discerning those reasons more clearly, not just try
not to eat less and less, which is what a lot of people try to do.
Don\'t eat it if you don\'t need to, but don\'t not eat it just because
you don\'t know where your motivation is rooted. The practice is about
discerning your motivation and re-rooting it in wholesomeness.

You begin by eating out of sensuality, for beautification, for
entertainment, you don\'t start eating with a clear mind, but if you eat
just to remove the hunger, you will get to see what a burden and a chore
eating is. If you sustain that correct context then all the previous
wrong reasons will disappear.

> -- MN 152

You don\'t have to try and micro-manage your meals because trying to
control those external circumstances won\'t uproot your greed because it
is not in the food. All you need to do is sustain the correct context,
heat up the iron pan, and your previous wrong reasons for eating will
diminish.

**Nm:** How many contemporary teachings teach how to purify your mind
from obstructive states? Most of the instructions just tell you to focus
on an object, but how is that purifying your mind? A person does these
techniques hoping that no obstructive states will arise, but they are
not purifying it. You cannot just start cleansing your mind because you
do not start out even seeing your mind, let alone states which are
obstructive for the mind. You need to first be well restrained with the
discipline, celibate, seeing the danger in the slightest fault, not
entertaining the signs and features that would be increasing hindrances,
then be moderate in eating, having that clarity of motivation behind
eating, because for most people that is completely invisible. Most
people don\'t keep precepts or practice celibacy, most people live with
a mind wet with sensuality and don't guard their senses, they don\'t
even see the signs and features of the mind. When they hear about
guarding the sense faculties, they think that they must not see or hear
anything. They don\'t try to discipline their senses, they try to kill
them. But if you do all the things that we just discussed, then you will
have clarity of mind, which is protected through guarding the senses,
you will discern the gateway where non-arisen unwholesome states can
enter.

Being watchful of your actions throughout the day means that your mind
is staying with that which is the priority, which is 'the guarding of
the gateway' of your mind, so that there are no obstructions for it.
That\'s the sole task you have which can be outlined through discipline,
guarding the senses and being moderate in eating. You will end up just
having to guard the entrance of the gateway, you don\'t have to be
running around. The gateway is that one entrance into the city which is
walled all round. That wall is your discipline and sense restraint.
That\'s why sila and celibacy is not optional if you want to practice.

**Q:** 

> "When the monk is one who is devoted to wakefulness... the Tathāgata
> then trains him further: '(5)Come, monk. Be one who is possessed of
> mindfulness & awareness. When going forward & returning, make yourself
> aware. When looking toward & looking away.... When bending & extending
> your limbs.... When carrying your outer cloak, upper robe, & bowl....
> When eating, drinking, chewing, & tasting.... When urinating &
> defecating.... When walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking
> up, talking, & remaining silent, make yourself aware."

**Nm:** To compose that previous wakefulness/vigilance even further, one
needs to bring that context of wakefulness that you have developed, 'the
guard post', and intensify it. You don\'t need to be doing that in some
formal hour of focusing meditation, but rather it\'s done whether you
are going to the toilet, extending your arm, laying down, cleaning ,etc.
So that even while you are doing all these tasks, the guard post is
clear and you are not abandoning that one job that you have, which is to
protect the mind from obstructive states.

Also, just notice at what stage in the training that the Buddha presents
this. I say this because many people try to start here, thinking that by
focusing on their hands or feet, they are doing mindfulness and
awareness. There is no 'focusing' in 'mindfulness and awareness', it\'s
about developing the right context to an unshakeable extent. It\'s about
being able to see the signs and features of your mind, its inclinations
and protect it from obstructive states before they even arise. The
seeing of signs and features needs to be discerned in the background,
it\'s not something that you can stare at, because signs and features
are in the background of that which you are attending to. You cannot see
the mind as an object of your senses but you can discern it peripherally
and know it. That\'s the principle of cittanimtta.

**Q:**\

> "When the monk is one who is possessed of mindfulness & awareness...
> the Tathāgata then trains him further: '(6)Come, monk. Seek out a

**Nm:** If you want to abandon the hindrances which is a prerequisite
for entering jhana, then you need to be dwelling with your mindfulness
thorouhghly established, which means you need to be watchful all the
time, which means you need to be moderate in eating, guarding the
senses, celibate and keeping the precepts. In other words if you want to
enter jhana, start being celibate. You can realize that jhana is an
establishment of mind that results from your own efforts of purifying
your lifestyle. It\'s not a magical experience that will purify your
life for you. Jhana is one of the last positive symptoms of you healing
the wounds of lust, hatred and ignorance. Dwell secluded, removing grief
and concern regarding the world, abandon the hindrances, quite secluded
from unwholesome states, the pleasure of seclusion is born, you feel
safe and that\'s the entering and abiding in jhana. It\'s not the other
way round.

Jhana is a divine abiding, as the Buddha stated\" when the Tathagatas
mind is in jhana, whatever he does is divine...". You can live in jhana
because the mind is purified, the senses tamed, the body guarded, the
guard post has not been abandoned, you have not been giving in to that
which makes hindrances overwhelm you, so you are freed from them. The
important thing is that jhana is the"8th step\" in the gradual training,
which is where many contemporary teachings like to begin the training,
by bypassing all the prerequisites. Which is quite convenient for
ignorance.

If you withdraw yourself from the unwholesome, you don\'t have to worry
about jhana, that is jhana. You don\'t have to worry about a technique,
which incidentally you will not find in the suttas. The closest thing to
a method is what we have just been describing, the gradual training -
*Sekha Paṭipadā*.

## 206hh- The Pleasure of Non-Activity

***

[Theragatha 19.1 -Talaputta](https://suttacentral.net/thag19.1):

> \"Oh, when will I stay in a mountain cave,\
> alone, with no companion,\
> discerning all states of existence as impermanent?\
> This hope of mine, when will it be?....
>
> ....For many years you begged me,\
> "Enough of living in a house for you!"\
> Why do you not urge me on, mind,\
> now that I've gone forth as an ascetic?
>
> \...Mind, when you urge me to the impermanent and unstable,\
> you're acting like someone who plants trees,\
> then, when they're about to fruit,\
> wishes to cut down the very same trees.\
> Incorporeal mind, far-traveller, lone-wanderer:\
> I won't do your bidding any more.\
> Sensual pleasures are suffering, painful, and very dangerous;\
> I'll wander with my mind focused only on Nibbana\...
>
> \...The men and women who live under your will and command,\
> whatever pleasure they experience,\
> they are ignorant and fall under Māra's control;\
> loving life, they're your disciples, mind.\"

**Nm:** That\'s everyone\'s relationship with their mind, the only
difference is how much perspective you have towards it or how much you
identify with it. The mind presents you with these ideas which you
accept and act out of and then you assume the ownership of them, but you
didn\'t have a say in their creation, in their arising, the mind came up
with it, so you can realise that it\'s not about "me" coming up with it
or "me" owning or disowning that which is not in my control. What is up
to me, is whether I choose to accept what the mind offers up. In the
same sense whether you choose to go where the eyes want to see. The eyes
want to go in a direction which you do not have to accept, but if people
have no self awareness and perspective developed through sense
restraint, then for them that pull is "theirs\'\', and ironically, they
are being pulled against their will but they believe that that\'s what
they want to do. For Talaputta, in that sutta, he already had some
wisdom because he was already able to see the mind as"this thing", as he
said"Oh you urged me to do this, I did this, and now you want to go
back". Now if he didn\'t have wisdom, he would have just thought"I want
to go back", but he questioned the thought:"Is this what I want? No,
this is what my mind wants and that\'s clear enough but is this what I
want?\...no, I do not want to eat what has been "vomited up", so to
speak. I was miserable over there and that\'s why I left, so I don\'t
want to do it, but the mind still wants it.\" So there\'s a conflict,
you have a choice, either give into the mind in order to not endure the
conflict or tame the mind in order to resolve the conflict, there will
be no more conflict when you(wisdom) are in charge.

**Q:** In the beginning the mind offered him something quite
appealing...

**Nm:** Yes, due to his own contemplation and choices. He also met the
Buddha and at that time his mind thought that this training was worth
doing. Even his own mind was not happy in that environment, which is why
it presented him with these romantic ideas about living in the forests,
but when the reality of those romantic ideas sets in, the hardships,
enduring the insects, etc, then the mind changed its mind: "Ohhh, I want
to go back now", but he questioned it: \"My mind has changed but shall I
follow it\...No\". It\'s like when you start seeing yourself as this
creature, this six sensed animal. Those senses will want to pull you in
the direction they want to go but it\'s you who needs to stop
gratuitously identifying with them and giving into their pressure and
then they will obey eventually, and how long that will take depends on
how much effort you put in.

The mind directs the other animals and it\'s the hardest to tame but
it\'s still the same principle. You can recognise that when you have a
thought, you can reflect further on it. For example, when the mind is
interested in sensuality, it will not think about the ugly aspects which
are simultaneously present there but you can make it do so, and that\'s
what Talaputta decided to do: "No I will tie you down mind and I will
stay here where you first told me to go, because it was a good idea,
thank you, but now we are not changing this, we will stay here until you
listen to me, not the other way around." So it\'s not about not having
those thoughts and trying to prevent them from arising, thinking: \"Oh I
shouldn\'t be thinking this\'\'. No, it\'s not up to you what you think,
it\'s up to your mind, but you should not be acting out of it, acting
upon it and accepting it without further consideration, that\'s on you.
You know exactly where the line is, you know where your responsibility
lies, the mind can come up with whatever it wants, all you need to do is
to not entertain or encourage it, if what it offers is unwholesome.

It\'s up to you to choose to accept the offer of the mind or not, to go
with it or not, and it\'s also up to you to choose whether you allow it
to keep dwelling and revolving around a particular subject. It needs
your input and encouragement to keep revolving around sensuality or ill
will. You can develop the perception of danger or the perception of
abandoning, in those thoughts so that while the mind is thinking those
thoughts of sensuality, you are not wanting them and abandoning them
because they are dangerous. Instead of thinking: "I will have this mind,
never think of that again!". That might be the final outcome of you
being completely dispassionate with what your mind presents you with,
but until then the mind will be presenting you with stuff the same as
any other sense will be presenting you with things it wants to do. You
must just not welcome thoughts if you know and see that it\'s rooted in
sensuality, ill will or distraction. It doesn\'t mean that you should
think: "I don\'t want it, so let me make these thoughts go away!". No,
it means that you should think: "I don\'t want it, now let me endure
this unruly mind that is trying to harass me with these thoughts."

**Q:** 

> "\...The Blessed One said,"Monks, if you are asked by wanderers of
> other sects, 'Friends, there are these three qualities. Which three?
> Lust, aversion, and delusion. These are the three qualities. Now what
> is the difference, what is the distinction, what is the distinguishing

> -- [AN 3.68](https://suttacentral.net/an3.68)

**Nm:** Delusion is not a missing piece of information, it\'s an
existential attitude that you have towards your senses. That\'s why I
often refer to it as distraction because it\'s an active thing, it\'s
something that you are liable to and doing here and now. Just like greed
and aversion, delusion is something you welcome, act upon, accept and do
not understand. It\'s not like something you don\'t know, it\'s
something that you keep doing which is mistaken. It\'s the attitude of
distraction, it\'s about the movement of distraction, the movement of
having something to do to maintain your being. A good indicator would be
to measure it with boredom. If you are easily bored, that means you have
accumulated a lot of delusions that will be difficult to see and hard to
fade. If you never get bored, then you are at least an Anagami or
Arahant where there is no pressure of non-activity, no pressure to do
anything or to distract yourself or look away from nothing happening,
nothing being felt.

Practically speaking, boredom is a good way to practice. People don\'t
see boredom as an indicator and certainly don\'t see delusion as an
attitude that they cultivate, despite commitment to precepts, suttas,
and meditation. They always try to deal with boredom. Even when they are
practising, their meditation technique becomes something they do on
account of avoiding boredom. Your reading suttas or scholarly work
becomes something you do on account of avoiding boredom. Yes, you need
to know the suttas and collect that information in order to know what to
look for but sooner or later you need to start uprooting delusion for
what it is, and for that you need to endure and not depend on some
activity to keep you occupied and engaged and connected to the senses.
For example, if you decide to get bored, switch your phone off, close
the doors and curtains, it doesn\'t matter whether you sit, walk, stand
or lay down, close your books, switch off the television, don\'t do your
meditation technique, just abide in non-activity. The mind will then be
presenting you with something to do, which is fine, you don\'t try to
get rid of those thoughts, you just don\'t act upon them. However, if
you decide to get up or go to the toilet, those are not the kind of
activities that will distract you, but if you think: "Let me just check
my email\...", well that\'s an activity of a kind that will distract
you, and so you don\'t do that. Now if you do that for an hour, you will
probably feel intense boredom, and that\'s why people fear solitude or
confinement where there is nothing to distract their senses. That can be
frightening, but in itself it\'s not frightening. It is frightening
because you have always been depending on the momentum of action, but
that\'s a gratuitous dependency that you have been cultivating because
you didn\'t know any better and for as long you don\'t know any better
you will be cultivating it.

**Q:** [SN 9.10 Sajjhāya Sutta](https://suttacentral.net/sn9.10):

> \"On one occasion a certain bhikkhu was dwelling among the Kosalans in
> a certain woodland thicket. Now on that occasion that bhikkhu had been
> excessively engrossed in recitation, but on a later occasion he passed
> the time living in non-activity (indifferent, withdrawn, at ease) and
> keeping silent. Then the devata that inhabited that woodland thicket,
> no longer hearing that bhikkhu recite the Dhamma, approached him and
> addressed him in verse: \"Bhikkhu, why don\'t you recite
> Dhamma-stanzas, Living in communion with other bhikkhus? Hearing the
> Dhamma, one gains confidence; In this very life \[the reciter\] gains
> praise.\"
>
> The bhikkhu replied: \"In the past I was fond of reciting
> Dhamma-stanzas, so long as I had not achieved dispassion. But from the
> time I achieved dispassion, I dwell in what the good men call: \"The
> laying down by final knowledge of whatever is seen, heard, or
> sensed.\"

**Nm:** Are you delighting in projects and work? If yes, that means you
are delighting in distraction. Just try abide in true non-activity for
an hour or two, no meditation techniques or trying to be mindful, just
sit there, don\'t fall asleep, get up or walk back and forth if you are
sleepy, and just allow your mind to come up with ideas and things to do,
planning and then don\'t commit to them, just let those thoughts endure
and just sit about. Do that for a few hours and you will see that there
is going to be a space created between you and your senses, because that
identification that people naturally jump into, i.e, "When eye wants to
see = I want to see", that identification, that proximity with the
senses needs maintenance. However, if you don\'t act upon impulse and
create that space, then you will get to see this sense creature for what
it is, the mind THERE with thoughts wanting to do this and that, the
monkey mind, you get to see it because you stop getting driven by it.
Now say that that is your practice for most of the day, abiding in
non-activity, wakeful, watching your mind, and then when you commit to
do something with body, speech or mind, you do so only on the level of
that recognition that it will not cause further distraction. You do them
through the mind of non-activity, non-distraction. That\'s why in jhana
you can walk, eat, go to the toilet, etc, it\'s not like you're frozen
motionless. Non-activity means no activity that is rooted in
distraction. It will also then become clear what you are not distracting
yourself from, which is - yourself, the six sensed creature, the
pressure.

That\'s why people fear boredom, it will always turn into existential
anxiety, because you start seeing how divorced from your own sense you
are, from the things that you identify with, things that define who or
what you are. It\'s just like if someone releases a balloon which floats
away higher and higher, that\'s your mind, there is no end to how high
it can go, and there is no problem in how high it goes, the problem is
from your expectation, need and dependence on being tethered to the
senses, because you haven\'t been restraining yourself enough, you
haven\'t been seeing the danger in the slightest fault, so you have been
depending on action through your senses.

Everybody depends on having something to do, but some depend on it more
than others, like when a person constantly needs to be active and when
they are not active they get bored, restless and then anxiety sets in,
and then no matter how insignificant something is, it becomes the most
important thing that must be done. That anxiety and desperation is only
there because they refuse to give up the gratuitous assumption that the
senses belong to them and are worth holding onto. If you give that up
then non-activity is the most sublime thing, but as I said, the pleasure
of jhana, the pleasure of the neutral feeling needs to be understood and
developed, it\'s not automatic. That\'s also why, let\'s say, if you
have been confined in a room for a long time and then you are released,
it doesn\'t matter how unpleasant a chore you would have to go and do,
you will enjoy it because at least you feel that there is something for
you to do, if you are still dependent on action. Now you can realise
that having the pleasure of something to do is determined from how far
your mind has withdrawn, but then you see people who never experience
boredom because they always have something to do and to distract
themselves with, they are people who really go into sensuality. There is
nothing sensual about cleaning a toilet, you just enjoy the action in
itself because the boredom was a bit too much to handle, but say you
never experienced boredom or seperation or withdrawal from the senses,
no perspective in regard to them, all you do is engage in the senses,
that\'s when you now need even more engagement for any sense of pleasure
and that\'s why the more you engage in sensuality the less pleasure you
feel and the more you need to engage. But say you have been withdrawn
from sensuality for a long time then even just a little bit of mundane
engagement with the senses will be agreeable, but that doesn\'t
constitute sensuality. Engaging with a sense in itself does not
constitute sensuality.

The Buddha describes the difference between pleasure that is underlied
by more craving and pleasure that isn\'t. Pleasure of cleaning the
toilet is not underlined by craving it\'s actually determined by the
fact that you haven\'t been engaging in sensuality and you don\'t need
to fear that pleasure but you need to be careful because you might then
be trying to find random things to do because they are not sensual but
they can become distracting and if they do, then your mind will start
thinking sensual thoughts, and that\'s the same principle taken even
further.

Now say you don\'t fear the boredom or neutral feeling anymore, it\'s
not felt unpleasantly because you have understood it, you basically live
withdrawn from sensuality, you have developed jhana, so your mind is now
even more established on the separation from the senses and their pulls.
That\'s why then from that perspective, even enduring discomfort will
feel like divine pleasure. From the point of view of boredom, cleaning
the toilet will feel exhilarating, from the point of view of jhana,
physical endurance like eating rough food, living at the root of a tree,
wearing rough robes, using harsh medicines, will feel like the finest
requisites. It\'s the same principle, determined by how much your mind
is withdrawn that determines how pleasantly the engagement will be
experienced. Not in itself, but for some people who get as much
sensuality as they want, they feel numb because they have been engaging
with that level for so long, their mind has not been withdrawn. It\'s
the same principle of withdrawal, in boredom, if you work through it, if
you don\'t act out of it and even endure that anxiety if it arises, then
even chores will be felt as agreeable. Now if you develop that further
into a jhana, then even if you don\'t do any chores, just enduring the
elements will be agreeable, will be felt pleasantly from the point of
view of being so withdrawn, and that\'s why the Buddha encouraged the
venerable Anuruddha to develop jhana:

> \"\...Now, when you think these eight thoughts of a great person and
> become a person who can attain at will, without trouble or difficulty,
> these four jhānas---heightened mental states providing a pleasant
> abiding in the here & now---then your robe of cast-off rags will seem

> -- [AN 8.30](https://suttacentral.net/an8.30)

You don\'t need to fear enjoying rough robes and thinking that it is
sensuality. Only a person who is not free from sensuality would use that
as a reference and think everything is sensuality because that\'s the
only reference they have. Even the Buddha himself initially thought that
the pleasure of withdrawal is unwholesome:

> "I (the Buddha) thought: 'I recall once, when my father the Sakyan was
> working, and I was sitting in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree,
> then---quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful
> qualities---I entered & remained in the first jhāna: rapture &
> pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought & evaluation. Could
> that be the path to awakening?' Then there was the thought following
> that memory: 'That is the path to awakening.' I thought: 'So why am I
> afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality,
> nothing to do with unskillful qualities?' I thought: 'I am no longer
> afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality,
> nothing to do with unskillful qualities, but that pleasure is not easy
> to achieve with a body so extremely emaciated..." 

> -- [MN 36](https://suttacentral.net/mn36)

If you are enjoying living in the jungle wearing rough robes and
enduring insects, if you find that agreeable, you don\'t need to fear
that as though it was sensuality, because it is not. That agreeability
of it is determined by your state of lofty mind. If you are not
distracting yourself, you will inevitably find things enjoyable, and if
you develop jhanas, even the extreme pain of disease can be endured
because your mind can attain jhanas at will. In other words, if your
mind can reestablish itself as fully withdrawn and independent of any
sense at any time, then how could it be bothered by anything that comes
through any sense?

> "Then Venerable Mahākassapa went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down
> to one side. The Buddha said to him:"You're old now, Kassapa. Those

> -- [SN 16.5](https://suttacentral.net/sn16.5)

The relativity of hardship and endurance is determined by how much your
mind is withdrawn from these things or not and that\'s why it\'s not
incidental that boredom is that thing that nobody wants to deal with,
even people who practice the dhamma, they do so to avoid sinking into
that boredom.

Say you have been sitting for a few hours in your room, everything is
switched off, no notifications, no activity, and then you want to get up
and drink tea, that\'s fine, but now your mind starts to overthink it,
wants to get into the details, that\'s what you do not welcome, which
does not mean that you have to never drink tea again. You will not lose
sight of yourself which means even the making of the tea will not become
a basis for that self-deluding whereby you become unaware of yourself
and fall into the identification of the senses you are engaging with,
you still maintain that distance, that right perspective.

**Q:** If you are living in such a non-distracted way, your life
naturally becomes simple and minimalistic.

**Nm:** The amount of proliferation and elaboration towards the senses
and engagement with them will have to fade. That\'s why walking, talking
and sleeping, is not sensual in itself, but can be the basis for slowing
down the sotapannas progress. For one with the right view, if he were to
practice sense restraint and learn to abide in non-activity even more,
he can become an Arahant in this life, but some get distracted with work
talk and sleep which becomes an obstruction to their own progress.
That\'s why the Buddha admonished some of his ariyan disciples:

The amount of work that they were engaged with was obviously not
necessary and the Buddha rebuked them even though that work was not
sensual. If you lose the context and do not maintain your motivation
behind your engagement with work, talk and sleep, it will then become a
basis for maintaining delusion. Obviously for an Ariyan, he maintains
that delusion much subtler than a puthujjana would be doing but it\'s
still a form of that self distraction and all he would need to do is not
engage or not allow himself to be engaged with work, talk and sleep for
the purpose of distraction, then he will progress towards Nibbana, there
is no other effort he needs to make because he has already understood
the Dhamma.

**Q:** He makes an effort in non-activity...

**Nm:** Well it\'s the effort in protecting the mind of non-activity, as
it is praised in the suttas:

> \"\...then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus: \"Come,
> bhikkhu, tell that bhikkhu in my name that the Teacher calls him.\"
>
> \"Yes, venerable sir,\" that bhikkhu replied, and he went to that
> bhikkhu and told him: \"The Teacher calls you, friend.\"
>
> \"Yes, friend,\" that bhikkhu replied, and he approached the Blessed
> One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.
>
> The Blessed One then said to him: \"Is it true, bhikkhu, that after
> returning from the alms round you enter your dwelling after the meal
> and pass the time living in non-activity and keeping silent, and you
> do not render service to the bhikkhus at the time of making robes?\"
>
> \"I am doing my own duty, venerable sir. \"
>
> Then the Blessed One, having known with his own mind the reflection in
> that bhikkhu\'s mind, addressed the bhikkhus thus:
>
> \"Bhikkhus, do not find fault with this bhikkhu. This bhikkhu is one
> who gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhanas that
> constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant dwelling in this
> very life. And he is one who, by realising it for himself with direct
> knowledge, in this very life enters and dwells in that unsurpassed
> goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth
> from the household life into homelessness.\" 

> -- [SN 21.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn21.4)

That pleasant abiding here and now paired with your right view is
basically jhana that leads you to nibbana. But as I said many times,
jhana is not a product of your activity, jhana is a product of
withdrawal from the senses and engagement from the unwholesome, it\'s
the pleasure and security that comes from that type of non-activity. But
again, non-activity is whether you are motivated by distraction or not,
and not whether you are motionless or moving about. You might jump to
the conclusion that non-activity means being motionless for 3 hours,
refusing to move because that will be a distraction from non-activity.
No, non-activity means non-distraction (\*devoted to
vigilance/watchfulness/non-distraction - *jagariyam-anuyoga*).

Just sit in your room and you will see in just a short time the mind
will present you with something to do. If you are relishing that offer,
that is the activity, that is the distraction. However, not acting on
the impulse to act is already creating some space between you and the
senses, that\'s why none of this will be possible if you do not first
get accomplished in the first few steps of the gradual training (
1-keeping the precepts, 2-guarding the senses, 3-moderation in eating,
4- devoted to watchfulness, \...). Non-activity is not using any type of
action for the means of distracting yourself from yourself or for losing
the perspective of this creature that needs to be contained, tamed and
watched.

**Q:** And there\'s nothing like the maintaining of the right
perspective for the diminishing of delusion.

**Nm:** Sure, if you start giving in to these distracting activities,
the right perspective will diminish or will be more obscured, and if you
don\'t give in to those acts of self-distraction, the right perspective
is maintained. You don\'t need to try to keep the perspective, all you
need to do is protect it from distraction. Once you stop being engaged
with the world with work and whatever else you have to do, you can then
realise that there is enough space for you here to see if the actions
that you are about to do are being used for the pleasure of indolence
and forgetting about this creature that you do need to keep an eye on.
(You don\'t need to be choking that creature and tying it up, but you do
need to not lose sight of it.)

So now that you have finished your work and return home to rest, does
that include binge watching movies, having a drink, listening to music,
etc? Why do you need to do that in order to relax? All you need to do
for relaxation is not do any work. You can easily relax yourself by
doing nothing or something non-distracting that will not result in you
wanting to do more of it and losing sight of yourself. You want to relax
but not to the point where you lose sight of the creature that you need
to keep an eye on. Often people conflate the two, thinking: 'I have done
my work, now I can relax\", which means I can lose sight and become
distracted. No, you can relax, but at no point does that mean that you
should lose sight of the six-sensed creature. That\'s the difference
between activity and non-activity. If you don\'t lose the sight of the
creature, you will not be acting on the level of the creature even if
you are doing chores, you will be doing them through the mind of
non-activity, only to the minimal point of need and fulfilling the
purpose and then you are back in non-activity abiding in jhana. Same
with eating, you do it to the extent that you need it, and eating more
than you need is no longer seen as pleasant because what is pleasurable
is protecting the mind of non-distraction which makes everything else
pleasurable from that higher stance. You realise that\'s the true
pleasure, pleasure which is not underlied by craving for more. That type
of pleasure is not unwholesome, it\'s safe and you are mindful in it, so
it\'s a win-win.

**Q:** [MN 36 Mahāsaccaka sutta](https://suttacentral.net/mn36):

> "Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at

> Then, as Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha's son was walking and wandering for

> Nigaṇṭha's son went up to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with

> one side and said to the Blessed One:
>
> "Master Gotama, there are some contemplatives who abide pursuing

>
> "But, Aggivessana, what have you learned about development of body?"
>
> "Well, there are, for example, Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Sankicca, Makkhali
> Gosāla. They go naked, rejecting conventions, licking their hands, not
> coming when asked, not stopping when asked; they do not accept food

> receive nothing from a pot, from a bowl, across a threshold, across a
> stick, across a pestle, from two eating together, from a pregnant
> woman, from a woman breastfeeding, from a woman in the midst of men,
> from where food is advertised to be distributed, from where a dog is
> waiting, from where flies are buzzing; they accept no fish or meat,
> they drink no liquor, wine, or fermented brew. They keep to one house,
> to one morsel; they keep to two houses, to two morsels...they keep to
> seven houses, to seven morsels. They live on one saucerful a day, on
> two saucerfuls a day...on seven saucerfuls a day. They take food once

>
> "But do they subsist on so little, Aggivessana?"
>
> "No, Master Gotama, sometimes they consume excellent hard food, eat
> excellent soft food, taste excellent delicacies, drink excellent
> drinks. Thereby they regain their strength, fortify themselves, and
> become fat."
>
> "What they earlier abandoned, Aggivessana, they later gather together
> again. That is how there is increase and decrease of this body. But
> what have you learned about development of mind?"
>
> When Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha's son was asked by the Blessed One about
> development of mind, he was unable to answer.
>
> Then the Blessed One told him: "What you have just spoken of as

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ajahn Nyanamoli:** If you're not devaluing sensuality, if you're still
valuing it, holding on to it as a valuable thing, if you're not seeing
the danger in it, that means you're still within the domain of
sensuality, even if you're not engaging in it, even if you're just
torturing yourself, not eating and just drinking water and so on, you're
still doing that with sensuality.

**Q:** So even if you are doing ascetic practices of renouncing food or
living alone and so on, that doesn't mean that you are practicing
renunciation of sensuality. If you're still delighting in the prospect
of future sensual experiences then you have not renounced those things
at all. And all you are doing is just a "temporary fast" so that you can
enjoy indulging once again. Doing a little bit of renunciation so that
you can indulge later on and not feel so guilty about it.

**Nm:** Your abstinence is temporary, which means that the overall
framework of sensuality remains, and you're not relinquishing that. You
might be playing with it and restraining yourself for whatever reason,
but overall, the value of sensuality remains unchanged. So that's what I
meant when I said, for example when you do keep virtue and practice
sense restraint and endurance, you have to do that with the attitude of,
"I will do this infinitely, forever. It doesn't matter how long this
lasts, I will have to endure it forever". Not like, "I'll do this for a
week". And then what? "...then I'll....most likely go back to the same
sensual actions of chasing sensual pleasure". Well, that's why you're
not free. Not because you haven't endured enough, in fact you might have
already endured more than enough for wisdom to arise. But the wisdom
will not arise, because overall, you're not relinquishing the value of
sensuality. Not because you haven't endured the pressure of sensual
desires sufficiently.

**Q:**

> "...Again, Aggivessana, a second simile occurred to me spontaneously,

>
> "No, Master Gotama. Why not? Because it is a wet sappy piece of wood,

> if those good contemplatives do not feel painful, racking, piercing

> me spontaneously, never heard before..."

**Nm:** You're not in the water anymore, but the mind is still wet with
the value of sensuality. So it doesn't matter what you do, or how much
effort you're putting in, or how motionless and for how many hours you
sit in your meditation, if you have not, on the level of your views,
devalued sensuality forever, you are still within it. So there will be
no wisdom arising on account of whatever endurance you put up with,
because you do so while still valuing sensual pleasures.

**Q:**

> "Again, Aggivessana, a third simile occurred to me spontaneously,
> never heard before. Suppose there were a dry sapless piece of wood
> lying on dry land far from water, and a man came with an upper
> fire-stick, thinking: 'I shall light a fire, I shall produce heat.'
> What do you think, Aggivessana? Could the man light a fire and produce

>
> "Yes, Master Gotama. Why so? Because it is a dry sapless piece of

**Nm:** They would probably be able to light the fire with very little
effort, because the effort is determined by how wet the wood is. If it's
damp, you have to work even harder, but if it's really dry, or if you
actually invest your effort in drying the sticks, then it's going to
take very little physical effort to light the fire with it. So that's
why I often say, it doesn't matter whether you're a monk or a lay
person, if you want to practice the Dhamma, practically speaking, most
of the work comes down to drying your mind from sensuality, it doesn't
come down to finding the perfect technique or reading the exact sutta
that will make you enlightened. The reason why you're not enlightened
even after you have read all the suttas, is not because you haven't read
them enough or you haven't thought about them enough, it's because your
sticks are not dry enough.

It's not accidental that this aspect is always being overlooked, which
is why sensuality is so hard to get rid of, because it's easy to
overlook it.

Sense restraint is already the practice of Dhamma. Virtue is already the
practice of Dhamma, because you're "drying the sticks". Sometimes when
someone reads in a sutta of a person who seemingly just heard one
sentence from the Buddha and became enlightened, they assume, "Oh, he
was so lucky or it was the Buddha's special powers that made him
enlightened". No, the Buddha said himself, "I cannot make anyone
enlightened. I just point the way, and then they either choose to follow
it or not".

All the Buddha can do is point the way. So then how did that person in
the sutta get enlightened after just one sentence? Well, if you read a
little closer, it's because his mind was very dry on account of being
withdrawn from sensuality, and obviously, devaluing sensuality
thoroughly, because otherwise one sentence from the Buddha would not
have been enough for enlightenment. So now, when you read thousands of
the sentences from the Buddha and you're not enlightened, it's not
because you read them wrongly, or because they are different sentences.
It's because your sticks are wet. You can't light a fire because you're
not withdrawn from sensuality.

Practically speaking, most of the work, especially for a lay person who
wants to practice Dhamma without becoming a monastic, is about
withdrawing from sensuality in the lay world. And that is doable. It
doesn't mean it will be easy, or pleasant, but doable. The worst
possible thing to think or teach others is, "Oh, you don't have to
withdraw from sensuality, and you can practice for the fire, that the
Buddha says is impossible to achieve for as long as you don't dry the
sticks....but nevermind just keep practising without drying the sticks,
soaking them in water and the sticks will magically become dry, and the
fire of wisdom will arise and we will all be happy". It doesn't work
like that, as the Buddha described, all the effort that you put into
trying to light a fire with wet sticks will go to waste, because you
have not dried the sticks, through living physically withdrawn from
sensual pleasures, and internally abandoning the value you hold towards
sensual pleasures.

Withdrawal from sensuality, sustaining that mind withdrawn from
sensuality, it's not just doable, it's what the practice is. Becoming
immovable in that way, means that you might be one of those people that
only needs one sentence for right view and enlightenment, because you
did the actual work of drying your sticks from sensuality.

**Q:** You've done 80% of the work already.

**Nm:** Yes. Most people would be coming to practice the Dhamma with
genuine reasons, with serious determination, but at the same time, still
not completely devaluing sensuality, still thinking that they don't need
to devalue sensuality, thinking, "Oh, but I don't have to because I'm
not a monk", and that's why all the effort and all the determination
they have will not result in liberating wisdom.

All you need to do is read a sutta like the one we are discussing here,
whereby it is clearly stated that devaluing sensuality or valuing
renunciation is the necessary prerequisite, then you realise if you
complete that prerequisite of living withdrawn from sensuality, you will
need very little effort to light the fire.

**Q:**

> "...So too, Aggivessana, as to those contemplatives who live bodily
> withdrawn from sensual pleasures, and whose sensual desire, affection,
> infatuation, thirst, and fever for sensual pleasures has been fully
> abandoned internally, even if those good contemplatives feel painful,
> racking, piercing feelings due to exertion, they are capable of
> knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenment; and even if those good
> contemplatives do not feel painful, racking, piercing feelings due to
> exertion, they are capable of knowledge and vision and supreme
> enlightenment..."

**Nm:** Exactly, it doesn't matter whether they feel pain or not,
because being physically withdrawn from and abandoning the mistaken
value in sensuality, is where the work is, and then even a little
instruction from the sutta, let alone all the suttas that we have now in
many different translations and original Pali, and so on. If your sticks
are dry, you need maybe 10% of that, and you will start seeing things
clearly. It's impossible not to, because you are actually doing the work
on the level that matters.

Mentally abandoning sensuality is not simply about not thinking about
it, it means devaluing it.

Even if you physically step outside of the puddle of sensuality, the
swamp of sensuality, but still mentally value that water, you're not
withdrawn from it. You might be living on top of a mountain secluded
from sensual distractions, but mentally, you still value pleasure of the
senses, so you don't see the peril infinitely and forever. That's why
mentally you're not withdrawn from it. But if you start contemplating
the infinite peril, you will be withdrawing yourself both physically and
mentally. And then, things from the suttas will just start falling into
place. Much more than before. And then you just do one rub of those
sticks, and there is already smoke and fire starting because you have
dried the sticks properly.

What I'm trying to point out, because it's obviously a subtle thing
which people can easily misunderstand, it's not just, "I will never
think these sensual thoughts, that might present themselves", it's
whether you value, delight, entertain or indulge mentally in them. Do
you see the danger? Because by seeing the danger you are automatically
making yourself withdrawn from those values, from those types of
thoughts. Are you withdrawn? "No". That means you're not seeing the
danger. You can't decide, "I will mentally withdraw myself from it",
because that mind is already in it. However, you can make your mind
withdraw from it by seeing the danger in that which it values and you
will never see the danger in that which you value, if you think you
don't have to, if you think you're exempted from it, if you think
sensuality is not a problem, if you think sensuality is not "your"
problem, if you think because you're not a monk you don't need to
address this. Well, if you want to practice the Dhamma, it doesn't
matter whether you are a monk or not, the sticks still need to be dry.

When you ask "How do I let go?", do you ask that question when you are
at the peak of happiness and when life is comfortable? Do you ask how to
let go of that pleasure or excitement? No. That question is always asked
when there\'s something bothering you, when you're overwhelmed, when
something that you do not want is not going away, when you can\'t help
but keep revolving around something that\'s unpleasant. That\'s when you
want to know how to let go.

However, you have to stop trying to get rid of that suffering because
*letting go* entails developing wisdom in regard to the nature of not
being able to hold things in the first place. If you were truly
*holding* the loved one, they would not have passed, they would not have
changed, you would not have been experiencing suffering, you would have
been in control.

When things are comfortable, people don\'t want to look at the nature of
change or contemplate letting go.

When things are happy and bright. They fully develop a belief that they
are in control of what they own, what they possess, who they love, who
they are. But then when things change, as you know they will but you
have been ignoring that fact, NOW you want to let go. But real y now you
just want to not suffer the painful consequences which are the result of
you holding on.

It\'s also not a question of never engaging with the world because
things will change. It\'s about never losing perspective, in regard to
that which is subject to change, which is everything around you,
including yourself.

In other words, letting go is not something you do. Letting go is
understanding that you could not have held things in the first place.

> \"...Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu is practising in this way---'It could not

> -- [MN 106](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN106.html)

Don\'t just reflect on letting go when there is discomfort or when there
is pain, or when there is reminder of it, but do it at the peak of your
happiness. When everything is ne, everything is going your way, be aware
that it could have not been that way and it won\'t be that way. That
reflection and remembrance can result in a slight uneasiness, but that
is the gateway to that right perspective of recognising the true meaning
of *anicca* that the Buddha spoke about. *Anicca* means "subject to
change", it doesn\'t mean "changing al the time", it means "subject to
change, against your will , outside of your scope of your control, you
are subject to it".

Understanding *anicca*, understanding "being subject to change" means
letting go, it means preventing yourself from assuming that you are
holding on.

Often you will get given advice to just let go, but "just let go" is not
a matter of choice. Even *holding* is not a matter of choice. It\'s the
result of whether you have perspective in regard to what is subject to
change or if you\'re ignoring that. If you\'re ignoring the nature that
things are subject to change, that things are fundamental y not in your
control, then you\'re "holding", even if you don\'t think "I will hold
this dearly", you are already making something dear to you and you\'re
holding it blindly. If you\'re not ignoring that things are subject to
change, if you\'re consciously making an effort \"Oh look, this is my
dog, my pet I had it my whole life, his life can end, my life can end,
that\'s the most natural thing. But I don\'t want to think about it only
when it happens, and now pretend that it will never happen, and just
laugh it o and change the subject. Such an attitude means I am ignoring
the basic, crude, obvious reality of things being subjected to change,
that is against my will , and because of that I\'m holding on to things,
not because I look after the dog.

Just because I feed it doesn\'t mean I\'m attached. No. Only if I DO NOT
have perspective in regard to the dog being subject to change, or myself
being subject to change, then that\'s how I\'m holding, that\'s how I\'m
attached\". Likewise with family, possessions, wealth, health, things
you take for granted. You take them for granted by ignoring that they
are subject to change, because it\'s disconcerting to think about it.
You think you can avoid it by ignoring it, but then you pay the price
when they change and you're affected, and then you want to let go. But
that\'s just the result of everything else you\'ve been holding wrongly
before.

"How do I let go?", should be reformulated as \"How do I not lose
perspective in regard to that which I hold dearly and is subject to
change?

Well, by making an effort to think about these things, rightly, even if
you have to set some time aside everyday, like half an hour and just
contemplate how things are subject to change. When you are doing such a
contemplation, if you feel anxious, al ow that feeling to manifest,
because that is the feeling of the world that you\'re in. That anxiety
is the result of recognising the true nature of things, and initial y,
that\'s not going to be pleasant to the mind which up to that point, has
been making all the effort to ignore the nature of change. If somebody
is asking the question, "How to let go?" That means at least to that
extent, they have some sort of recognition of their responsibility in
their own suffering.

The suffering you\'re experiencing on account of not letting go is the
result of an underlying problem of ignoring that things are subject to
change. You don\'t admit that to yourself enough, you never let that
sink in deep enough, because it\'s felt unpleasantly. As simple as that.
Therefore, you can start letting go by admitting these things to
yourself, by contemplating it, and by enduring the unpleasantness of it
when it arises. You can realise that you have a choice, you\'re either
going to endure those mild anxieties and concerns on account of the
realisation that, "Yes, things will change and I will not ignore this".
Or you\'re going to pretend it\'s not there, and then be completely
crushed, when things do change against your will . That\'s when you will
be asking, "How do I let go?". You might even lose your mind with grief
and so on. So don\'t wait for that to prompt you to think about letting
go. Don\'t wait until it\'s too late.

You can let go or become detached by seeing that you could not have been
attached to it in the first place, and the only way to see that is to
contemplate that. It will prevent you from being attached the way you
are.

You cannot be attached to your pets or a loved one or possessions, if
you don\'t forget they can be taken away at any given second, and the
fact that that is a possibility, means they were never yours to begin
with, no matter how long you have been attached to them, no matter how
deeply you have loved them. It doesn\'t matter what you do, this is the
ultimate context, "THIS is subject to change, it\'s against my will",
that\'s *anicca*. Mindfulness of that context is worth developing
because it leads to true freedom.

If you do make the effort and sustain the perspective that, "My dear pet
can be taken away at any given time". That perspective will prevent you
from becoming blindly, carelessly, obliviously attached to it. And when
things change, there will not be as much of a shock to the system,
because you know beforehand that it is truly out of your hands. So the
grief will be seriously dampened, and if you\'ve truly developed a full
understanding of *anicca*, there will be no grief at all. Even for
people who are not monks or who are not committed to this practice 24/7,
it\'s still a useful thing to be aware of, the fact that things are
subject to change. It\'s quite a useful superpower that you can develop
in this life. It keeps you more resilient, more patient, more stable,
more impermeable to disruptions, because sometimes things might change
quickly into one thing and then into another, from very pleasant, to
intensely unpleasant, and you will still be able to sustain some sort of
composure in regard to it, which most people would not. Which means your
well being, your contentment will be less affected, even as an undevoted
practitioner.

It\'s always useful to have that authentic recognition of "things are
subject to change". But it needs to be done on that personal level.
Usual y when a person hears about *anicca*, it\'s often taken in this
abstract sense,

"Yes, everything is subject to change. Modern science has shown
everything is constantly changing, etc".

People tend to think about *anicca* in those completely impersonal
terms, but that\'s not *anicca*. *Anicca* is finding that which is dear
to you, and contemplating that to be subject to change, and then see how
indifferent you\'re going to stay if you start thinking like that. If
you work through that unease on account of contemplating the loss of
that which is personal y dear to you, that\'s where freedom from
suffering canbe found. The letting go that comes from understanding the
nature of things is how you will not suffer even when your dearest
family members, pets, friends, or whatever, change, die or leave. Your
mind will not be affected. That doesn\'t mean that you will not perceive
what has happened or not know the significance of an event, it just
means you will not be as affected by it because you never lost
perspective in regards to that which is inevitable- sickness, old age
and death.

## 212hh- How to be Happy

[[source pdf]](/hillside_hermitage_archive/source_pdfs/20210627 - 212hh - How to be happy.pdf){:target="blank"} [[external link]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uvch94Hi0sTe6R4T6Ma4miYwSmJd3wFN/view){:target="blank"}

***

The first thing you have to answer is what happiness is for you? Most
people generally go through life without even knowing what they want,
just following things that make them feel good, and avoiding things that
don't make them feel good. That doesn't necessarily mean that they're
following happiness. It just means that they are following an impulse.
So the first step in finding happiness would be to recognize the
difference between just going after things that might make you feel
pleasant at the time, and cultivating things that will lead to a
long-term sense of well-being.

I'm sure many people are aware of that difference. If you stop and think
about it, "What is it that makes me happy?", you will not necessarily
know but you would know that things that you've been chasing up to that
point have not resulted in contentment, which is really what happiness
is. It's not found in being pleased with a current experience that
you're enjoying, like being with your friends or having an outdoor
adventure, etc. It's found in being perpetually contented with yourself,
with your well-being no matter what life throws at you.

To achieve that, a certain kind of work is required, one of
self-reflection and not one of just energetically going after every
sensual desire that arises. By recognizing, through self-reflection, in
which direction happiness lies, you then have a better chance of finding
it. By clarifying for yourself what you want, what you need, and by
reflecting on your past experiences to see which one of those made you
happy in a sense that you were happy with yourself, content, and at
ease, that will give you a clearer picture as to what is useful for long
term contentment. Having such a clear picture is a necessary
prerequisite, and then what you will come to realize is that the most
common notion, the impulse-based notion of just chasing whatever the
present sense-desire is, it's more often than not, not the reason for
happiness, but instead results in you wanting even more, in you being
unsatisfied, unhappy, not contented, and becoming more desperately
driven, which is not a state of ease.

In other words, chasing sense pleasures, although that might provide you
with a momentary distraction from your dis-ease, you can realize, if you
do just a tiny bit of self-reflection, that those activities are not
where happiness is to be found, and that they only provide a temporary
satisfaction of your senses.

Most people who do not understand what happiness is would naturally
think, "Getting what I want is happiness." But how about not wanting
anything that you can or cannot get? If you don't desire anything, you
can't grieve over not getting what you want either. So you can realize
that happiness is a state of mind that you are responsible for. You
might not be responsible for things that you get, things that you don't
get, things that you had or lost, and so on. But you're certainly
responsible for the values that you place upon those things.

Do you place value in the objects of your senses? Or do you place value
on the contentment of the mind? If you place value in being perpetually
content, then it requires you to develop the ability to say no to
yourself, to draw a line for yourself, because otherwise, the sense
desires will take you into infinite directions that can never be
satisfied.

One needs to understand what happiness is. If you understand what
happiness is, even if you don't make any excessive direct effort towards
it, you will already be going towards it because you have a certain
clarity of what it is. Through understanding it, you would already have
a clearer picture as to where to draw the line for your sense desires,
when to say no, and so on.

For example, say that you want something, there's already the implicit
knowledge, whether that thing is necessary, or whether it will just be
another attempt to try and satisfy this insatiable thirst for sensual
gratification, and you know when it would probably be better if you were
to say no to yourself, it's not a hard thing to see, because that
knowledge is already implicit. The problem is just habitually acting out
of impulse.

Knowing what happiness is, is already a step forward toward contentment.
Knowing when to restrain yourself, and then taking responsibility for
when you do allow yourself to engage with your senses. That will make
the mind more in your control. Which brings us to the second point,
knowing what happiness is, is the prerequisite, it sets the direction
for you to develop a happy mind. The development of happiness is the
development of a mind that has been tamed.

The tamer and more control you have over your mind, the more at ease you
are with whatever circumstances life throws at you. Things will be less
challenging, so to speak, which doesn't mean everything will go your
way, but means that when things don't go your way, when you don't get
what you want, you will not lose perspective, because you haven't been
blindly or habitually acting out of impulse towards every whimsical
desire that arises. Knowing what happiness is, and developing certain
self-control regarding your mind and your mental state, will not occur
as a result of some magical recipe. Self-control arises on account of
the effort that you put into withstanding the pressure of your sense's
desires, learning how to draw a line, learning how to say no, then
enduring it and growing out of it. Happiness comes from taming your
mind, from freeing it of defilement.

## 215hh- Mindfulness Of Breathing And Calming Of The Aversion

> -- [SN 54.6](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn54/sn54.006.than.html)

Some might think that what Arittha described is not correct mindfulness
of breathing but the Buddha didn't disagree with him and then offered a
*different* practice. On the contrary, he acknowledged it but then added
that his practice is not complete. Then he went to describe how to
develop Ven Arittha's mindfulness of breathing to fulfilment. Arittha\'s
practice was enough for freedom from sensuality, which he claimed, and
the Buddha didn't dispute. However, it was not enough for final
liberation and uprooting of all conceit. So if you practice that
mindfulness of breathing in that simply sense that he described, which
is by the way how every anapanasati instruction begins : \"Recollected
he breathes in, Recollected he breathes out\", that\'s all you need to
know and if you stick to that as the Ven.Arittha did you will overcome
any desire towards sensual objects of the present, past and future. In
other words, you would have surmounted the entire domain of sensual
craving and most importantly you would have completely subdued that
*patigha* towards your own senses. Which is enough for having the five
lower fetters destroyed.

Mindfulness of breathing is often taken as a mechanical method, and so
to avoid that mistake, it would be better to first follow Ven.Arritha's
instructions because it would prevent you from falling into a mindless
'in-and-out-breathing-focussing-visualisation' technique. It would force
you to develop knowledge of the enduring breath underneath your
experience, regardless of the mental, emotional, or physical
state.(That\'s also how *anapanasati* brings *satipatthana* to
fulfilment.) As the Suttas say, recollected he breathes in or out. They
don't say "*focused*" or "*concentrated*" he breathes in or out.

If you overcome all sensuality and subdue all of the *patigha* that you
have towards your own senses and towards anything or anyone in the
world, present, past or future, then you will be ready to follow the
Buddha\'s detailed instructions on *anapanasati*. You will also know
exactly what he means, otherwise, you will be doing his instructions
with sensuality and as a method that you think will result in a
\"Greater sensual pleasure for me!\". Any greatness of mindfulness of
breathing can only be developed upon complete surmounting of sensuality
or overcoming the five lower fetters.

That breath underneath your experience that is always enduring and which
you don\'t lose sight of (the knowledge of the breath being there), is
an anchor for mindfulness. You can focus on that physical side if you
want but you must first know that the breathing is underneath you,
that\'s really what the anchor is. Using the enduring breath that\'s
already there happening to you, underneath your emotional state, etc, as
an anchor for mindfulness and then investing effort into not losing
sight of that peripherally. You don\'t need to stop doing what you are
doing in order to breathe, but you can certainly not allow yourself to
be absorbed into what you\'re doing, so that you forget that breathing
is happening in the background. It\'s about learning how not to overly
commit to the foreground attention and learning how to stretch your mind
to discern 'both ends' (background and foreground) simultaneously
enduring. That\'s why, when you develop *samadhi*/composure, the mind
becomes pliable, it can stretch, it\'s no longer a hard twisted lump.

**Q:** Having become accomplished in virtue and sense restraint, things
calm down and then the reality of the body becomes clearer.

**Nm:** That reality of the body will first present itself as unpleasant
and confining because you will experience the fundamental *patigha* that
you have towards it, you are going to experience this physical
resistance, sickness, like a heroin addict going through withdrawal
because you\'re withdrawing from the entire domain of 'sensual being'
(*kamabhava*). However, you have to abandon that *patigha*/aversion,
that aversion towards your own senses which are no longer engaging with
sensual distractions. That\'s why the sensual desire is so powerful
because the aversion towards being confined within the body underneath
it is extremely strong and the only means of escape, that an ordinary
person knows, is sensual pleasure, which is no escape at all.

**Q:** In a way, that\'s the first thing you do as you are born, your
first act is to try and escape that fundamental discomfort. Your senses
are agitated and you don\'t want that pain and so you automatically
reach away from that and into the direction of sensual objects.

**Nm:** That\'s what is meant by 'underlying tendencies'. The baby is
not doing anything but the mind is paired with the senses and they are
uncomfortable, however subtle it may be. There is nothing else there
except that discomfort for a newborn mind and what an unenlightened mind
does, regardless of the type of discomfort it is experiencing, is it
wants to get rid of it. So naturally on that fundamental level when the
baby is experiencing the discomfort of its new born body/senses, it
naturally goes in the direction of sense objects. Not that it chooses to
but the discomfort pushes it in that direction and then everything else
it starts encountering in the world, the mother, breastfeeding, etc,
just becomes a confirmation of that direction where it found relative
safety from this discomfort which itself is, this unsafety of the body.

**Q:** By knowing the sense organs for what they are, means that you
experience them as uncomfortable, pressured and agitated.

**Nm:** Yes, practically speaking, you will experience them as a
pressure. However there is only pressure when you have ignorance, which
the baby does, it has an underlying tendency of *avijja*. If there was
no *avijja* in that baby\'s mind, it would not have been born. If you
begin to know and see the sense organs clearly and sustain that clarity,
you will begin to diminish your ignorance in regards to them, your
appropriation of them, your assumption of ownership. You will get to
understand that resisting them is futile and therefore your aversion
will also fade.

**Q:** The body is fundamentally agitated.

**Nm:** The nature of form/*rupa* is to deform, the elements which it is
made up of are changing and reshaping and your body is doing the same.

**Q:** You cannot just remove that bodily discomfort because that is the
body. You have to somehow make peace with it.

**Nm:** By removing your aversion towards the senses, that\'s how you
make peace. You subdue all perceptions of *patigha* by thoroughly
developing sense restraint, keeping a close eye on them so that they
don\'t get polluted by the unwholesome.

**Q:** If you had to suppress the body, trying to not let it sense
anything, it would just get more agitated.

**Nm:** If you want to calm down these wild animals, these untamed sense
organs, you can\'t just give them what they want and you certainly
won\'t calm them down by beating and starving them either. You need to
give them the right kind of food when needed and not too much.

## 223hh- Practice Of Generosity

[[source pdf]](/hillside_hermitage_archive/source_pdfs/20210823 - 223hh - Practice of generosity.pdf){:target="blank"} [[external link]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mvkqv0mSdX2AN954E8M2IvypZFW2TYt6/view){:target="blank"}

***

**Q:** Is generosity beneficial?

**Nyanamoli:** The act of generosity is an act of giving things up. It
makes you and others feel good. It makes you give things up and feel
good on account of it. Giving up something of yours, part of your
wealth, earnings, possessions, you end up enjoying the fact that
somebody is happy on account of it. It's a less constricted state of
mind. There can be many layers of giving. Some people give by expecting
something back, but it doesn't matter. In itself, the phenomenon of
giving, still requires giving up, and that thread remains wholesome
throughout the giving, even if I give it with the desire for some future
benefit, it's still good to give. Sure, the best way to give is when you
are completely unattached to what you are giving. ([AN
7.49](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN7_49.html))

**Q:** I think generosity also provides the donor a sense of security.

**Nm:** It does and it is an uplifting act. It's a greater state of mind
than the mind of one who doesn't give. The mind that doesn't give always
revolves around habits of taking, possessing, owning, protecting,
worrying, trying to control things that are unownable, things which
cannot be protected, and can be taken away. The only way to sustain that
state is to keep doubling down, constricting the mind more and more and
more, which leads to a bad destination.

Giving prevents that from happening. Giving is like a pressure release
valve to that constriction, it will help your mind to open up. The act
of giving requires you to let go. When you give something up you receive
a greater elevation of mind, because you force your mind to back off,
step away from anything that you have been constricting yourself over.

The true purpose of generosity is to force your mind to expand. That's
why generosity, friendliness, all that goes hand in hand. It's a less
limiting, narrow state of mind.

**Q:** Why would a person be stingy?

**Nm:** Insecurity, fear of non-control. By "holding on" they get a
false sense of security, but it doesn't last long because what they are
holding on to is not secure. Their stinginess is the proliferation of
the sense of self that is being threatened by even little things that it
can't have. The more it proliferates, the more it will need for its
maintenance, and the more sensitive it will become. That's why you have
people who have many things and still it's never enough because they
have become psychologically locked into that pattern of always seeing
that it's never enough because deep down they know that their
attachments cannot be owned to begin with. You can have great amounts of
wealth and so on, but fundamentally, you will feel that it's not in your
control. Deep down, you know that. Why? Because you could die at any
given moment, the economy could crash, thieves could take it away and so
on. All of that is implicit in your 'ownership'. If you don't own it,
how can you be affected if it changes or goes away? That's exactly the
whole point of the encouragement that the Buddha gave to some monks in a
forest:

> "Bhikkhus, whatever is not yours, abandon it. When you have abandoned
> it, that will lead to your welfare and happiness. And what is it,
> bhikkhus, that is not yours? Form is not yours: abandon it. When you
> have abandoned it, that will lead to your welfare and happiness.
> Feeling is not yours ... Perception is not yours ... Intentions are
> not yours ... Consciousness is not yours: abandon it. When you have
> abandoned it, that will lead to your welfare and happiness.
>
> "Suppose people were to carry off the grass, sticks, branches, and
> foliage in this Jeta's Grove, or to burn them, or to do with them as
> they wish. Would you think: 'People are carrying us off, or burning
> us, or doing with us as they wish'?" "No, venerable sir. For what
> reason? Because, venerable sir, that is neither our self nor what
> belongs to our self."
>
> "So too, bhikkhus, form is not yours ... consciousness is not yours:
> abandon it. When you have abandoned it, that will lead to your welfare
> and happiness."

> -- [SN 22.33](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.33)

People who are stingy or miserly, lack wisdom in that regard, they don't
see that they cannot fundamentally own anything, they ignore that fact.
And as a result, they keep doubling down on the action of more ownership
and more control.

**Q:**

>
> "So it is, Sīha. So it is. At the break-up of the body, after death,

>
> One who gives is dear. People at large admire him. He gains honor. His

> the One Well-Gone."

> -- [AN 5.34](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN5_34.html)

**Nm:** Why would you become confident? Why would you not be as
confident if you're not generous? Why would generosity make you more
confident in any assembly?

Because it's a less limiting state of mind. Lack of confidence is an
extremely constricted state of mind, whereby you are afraid and insecure
in regard to many things most of the time. However, through generosity,
you're forcing your mind to expand, and when the state of mind is more
expansive, it is less constricted, less afraid, less able to twitch to
the left or to the right on the basis of some random perception. An
expansive mind can take more. The more limitless the mind, the more
confident you will be, not conceited, but confident, and simply less
moved, because the mind is broader.

**Q:** In that sense, the expanded mind of generosity is the cure for
social anxiety.

**Nm:** Exactly, social anxiety because of which I don't engage with
others because of which my anxiety increases because of which I don't
engage with others. It's a vicious circle. Well, generosity is a nice
way to engage with others, and in that way you start breaking the
vicious circle of anxiously non-engaging with others. And even a little
act of generosity is enough to set your mind at least to some extent, in
that direction of expansion. By being generous, you force your mind to
broaden.

Through generosity you get to override those thoughts of fear. You get
to elevate your mind above those thoughts even if those thoughts are
present. And then it doesn't matter if people laugh at you and so on.
What actually matters is that you actually did the generous deed. That's
why generosity is a practice. It's not like you do a generous act and
suddenly have this religious experience and everyone likes you. Of
course, somebody who has been very miserly, it might feel like
that,i.e. any little expansion from an extremely constricted mind will
feel like a religious experience.

Generosity is a practice. If you do it, if you develop it alongside
wisdom,i.e. you don't just start giving everything carelessly away, when
your own family's starving or go and give all your money to a casino.
But rather, when you can give, if you earn more than you need, you can
always dedicate part of those earnings towards giving, and you don't
have to overthink it, you don't make demands, just find what it's good
to give, who can be helped, and do it, and then practice doing it. In
that way, you will start building up that behaviour of generosity, that
will then become a quality which decorates your mind, and not just when
you are giving, even generally, you will know yourself as a generous
person, that knowledge, that decoration will be there in the background.
That's exactly one of the benefits. That knowledge will be in others as
well. It's not like you have to have an audience when you're giving all
the time. But if you are practising giving sufficiently enough, it will
be known. But you wouldn't care whether it's known to others or not, but
it will be known by you. That's a fact. That's why Buddha listed it as
one of the inevitable benefits.

> "...Then there is the case where you recollect your own generosity:
> 'It is a gain, a great gain for me, that among people overcome with
> the stain of possessiveness, I live at home, my awareness cleansed of
> the stain of possessiveness, freely generous, open handed, delighting
> in being magnanimous, responsive to requests, delighting in the
> distribution of alms.' At any time when a disciple of the noble ones
> is recollecting generosity, his mind is not overcome with passion, not
> overcome with aversion, not overcome with delusion. His mind heads
> straight, based on generosity. And when the mind is headed straight,
> the disciple of the noble ones gains a sense of the goal, gains a
> sense of the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. In one who
> is joyful, happiness arises. In one whose mind is happy, the body
> grows calm. One whose body is calmed experiences ease. In one at ease,
> the mind becomes composed..."

> -- [AN 11.12](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN11_12.html)

It's a practice that should be developed and encouraged for individual
benefit of your own mind expansion and benefit of others. You can also
encourage others to be generous by setting a good example, which will
then in return, help their own minds from escaping the state of insecure
constricted stinginess.

> "...This world is on fire with aging, illness, & death. With the world
> thus on fire with aging, illness, & death, any restraint of body,
> speech, and mind practiced here will be one's shelter, cave, island, &
> refuge after death in the world beyond." When a house is aflame, the

**What is ‘meditation’?**

In the broadest terms, if a person were not to know what meditation is, and have no notion of any techniques, the answer to that question would be that 'it's a way of calming your mind.'

It is learning how to calm your mind down skillfully, _without_ involving sensuality or distraction: that is thenwisdom, the work and the value of it. Most people simply follow their sense desires to acquire sense pleasures so that the mind calms down in regard to something else that bothers them. In other words, it’s just a cover up, pasting a cover on the wound that you don't want to deal with. Underneath it is still the same wound.

That is the difference between doing meditation for the right reasons, and doing meditation for the wrong reasons. Are you doing meditation just to get away from things, to not deal with them? Or, to calm your mind _in regard to_ the things that are still there, that are otherwise agitating you? Am I trying to avoid the pain, or am I trying to calm my mind in regard to the pain, not trying to get rid of it - that is the fundamental difference there.

That's why it is important what view a person carries in regard to meditation. Most contemporary meditation notions - even when people have genuine reasons [initially behind wanting to practice it] - imply some sort of special pleasant experience that you will get if you commit to a technique, a pleasure which will overwhelm you, and easily allow yourself to conclude that you had a very ‘successful meditation’.

That is not 'calming' to begin with; and also it is in line with the same principal of sensuality, i.e. ‘I'm bothered; let me do certain things - let me work, let me gain - and then [as a result of my efforts] let me enjoy this vast amount of pleasure that will make me very satisfied’.

Sometimes people realise that sensuality cannot really provide that [lasting satisfaction] - then they turn to meditation, but they don't change their attitude. The whole idea of jhanas being a pleasure that overwhelms you, a kind of ecstasy - is the exact same view of sensuality, just replacing the object that you usually chase with a different one.

Would you consider yourself to be calming yourself down; while you are cultivating expectations, asking ‘when will this pleasure arrive, when will it happen to me’? Is anticipation a calming quality? Of course not, but how many people can truly say they can meditate without the slightest view of anticipation? It is implicit when one comes across meditation contemporarily, Buddhist or otherwise. Looking for _what's happening_, so that you can interpret ‘what's happening’, waiting for things to happen, _hoping_ they will happen... that is meditating with sensuality. Waiting for _pleasant things to happen_ that will sort everything else out.

<blockquote class="english">
“The Blessed One, brahmin, did not praise every type of meditation, nor did he condemn every type of meditation. What kind of meditation did the Blessed One not praise? Here, brahmin, someone abides with his mind obsessed by sensual lust, a prey to sensual lust, and he does not understand as it actually is the escape from arisen sensual lust. While he harbours sensual lust within, he meditates, premeditates, out-meditates, and mismeditates. He abides with his mind obsessed by ill will, a prey to ill will…with his mind obsessed by sloth and torpor, a prey to sloth and torpor…with his mind obsessed by restlessness and remorse, a prey to restlessness and remorse…with his mind obsessed by doubt, a prey to doubt, and he does not understand as it actually is the escape from arisen doubt. While he harbours doubt within, he meditates, premeditates, out-meditates, and mismeditates. The Blessed One did not praise that kind of meditation.”

<blockquote class="english">
“When he harbors aversion toward painful feeling, the underlying tendency to aversion toward painful feeling lies behind this. Being contacted by a painful feeling, he seeks delight in sensual pleasure. For what reason? Because the untrained ordinary person does not know of any escape from painful feeling other than sensual pleasure.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="reference">
– SN 36.6
</blockquote>

When touched by pain, the only thing an untrained ordinary person knows is to seek pleasure. It doesn't matter whether he seeks pleasure through food, company, others - or meditation. _He seeks pleasure, because he doesn't want to deal with the pain._ That is why it is a sensual view that underlies that meditation - any meditation of that kind.

Meditation is not about replacing the experience that has arisen, it is about thoroughly knowing it while it's there. But the point will come when, in order to fully understand it, you need to learn how to stay calm, within it - and that is the role of the proper _samadhi_.

That is why the right view is the necessary basis for the right _samadhi_, because the right view will know that it is about enduring disorder. The mind is disturbed because the mind is not free, but if I just seek to replace this disturbance with a pleasurable experience, I haven't understood what needs to be understood. So what if I instead seek to calm myself _within_ the disturbing experience and within the agitated mind? Then the agitation disappears; so that, although that which agitated you is still there, now you get to understand it, because the mind sees clearly when it is calm.

The pleasure that the Buddha talks about, the pleasure that is different from the pleasure of sensuality - is that very pleasure of not being bothered, pleasure of being withdrawn, pleasure of sense restraint.

It is a pleasure that you cannot crave for more of, because it didn't come in that external sense of just replacing [one experience with another] - as in just something that overwhelms you. Even the pleasure of _jhana_ is the pleasure of that withdrawal from beforehand, that is what the pleasure belongs to, not to the _jhana_ [as such]. It is a result of that seclusion and non-activity.

<blockquote class="english">
“Here, bhikkhus, withdrawn from sense desire, withdrawn from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhāna/meditation … the second meditation … the third meditation … the fourth meditation. This is called the <u>pleasure of renunciation</u>, the <u>pleasure of seclusion</u>, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of enlightenment. I say of this kind of pleasure that it should be pursued, that it should be developed, that it should be cultivated, and that it should not be feared.” 
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="reference">
– MN 139
</blockquote>

What is truly disturbing is that movement of the mind - and you _seeking pleasure_ is just another movement. Another expectation, another anticipation, whether you get it or not doesn't matter - you are still relying on the perpetual movement of the mind, to remain floating. That is not peaceful or calming, even if you get all the pleasure you want in the world. So the true _samatha_, then is calming of those movements and those activities, or _sankharas_, intentions of the mind - calming that, within whatever you are intending towards, or against.

**Right meditation comes within right endurance  
_Patient endurance is the supreme austerity_ (Dhp 184)**

In order to calm your intentions on the mental level, you need to have calmed your body and speech, restrained it sufficiently long beforehand. THEN you can actually start calming that movement, the movement of the mind - but not at the expense of what is agitating you, that remains; that actually serves almost as a criteria for whether you are calm now, or not. It's easy to be calm when there is nothing bothering you. But the very reason people don't want to live in seclusion, not partake in company, and guard the sense doors - is that it is very disturbing.

That is why the gradual training is about _building that up_, because that is the most disturbing thing. When you start saying no to desiring sense pleasures and guarding the sense doors, avoiding company, it is very disturbing for the mind that depends on those movements, engagements and activities. Solitude, seclusion, withdrawal from the senses, confinement - it basically feels like dying. It is the withdrawal of a heavy addiction: [your mind is] an addict who has been depending on the senses for aeons, not only this life. If you think cigarettes are hard to give up, or heroin, try giving up the entire domain of pleasure dependent on the senses and existence in general.

**Q:** _Even on that small scale in terms of little things like addiction to smoking, you can get a glimpse of the relief that comes from not being agitated anymore by that particular craving._

**Ajahn Nyanamoli:** Imagine then the pleasure of the first _jhana_; when you are not drawn by anything in the world. No addiction, you are completely dry of it, such that even if you have thoughts [of sensual objects?], they are not _sensual thoughts_ in the sense of thoughts that would immediately pressure you. That's a true relief, a true peace, laying down a burden. But there is no magical way to achieve this, i.e - ‘watch your left nostril, watch your right, three steps left’ - there is only the withdrawal from that which you are addicted to. That is the 'magical way'; and you need to be _sufficiently_ withdrawn. For how long, depends on how strongly you were addicted.

**MN 107 - The Discourse to Ganaka-Moggallana:**

<blockquote class="english">
“...When the Tathāgata gets a person fit to be tamed, he first trains him thus:<br/>
<br/>
‘(1)Come, bhikkhu. Be virtuous. Dwell restrained in accordance with the Pāṭimokkha, consummate in your behavior & sphere of activity. Train yourself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults.’<br/>
<br/>
“When the monk is virtuous… seeing danger in the slightest faults, the Tathāgata then trains him further:<br/>
<br/>
‘(2)Come, monk. Be one who is guarded in the doors of your sense faculties. On seeing a form with the eye, don’t grasp at any signs and features (significance) by which—if you were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye—evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail you. Practice for its restraint. Protect the faculty of the eye. Attain restraint with regard to the faculty of the eye. On hearing a sound with the ear.… On smelling an aroma with the nose.… On tasting a flavor with the tongue.… On touching a tactile sensation with the body.… On cognizing an idea with the intellect, don’t grasp at any signs and features by which—if you were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect—evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail you. Practice for its restraint. Protect the faculty of the intellect. Attain restraint with regard to the faculty of the intellect.’<br/>
<br/>
“When the monk is one who is guarded in the doors of his sense faculties… the Tathāgata then trains him further:<br/>
<br/>
‘(3)Come, monk. Be one who eats for the right reasons. With a correct perspective (yonisomanasikara), take your food not playfully, nor for intoxication, nor for putting on bulk, nor for beautification, but simply for the survival and continuance of this body, for ending its afflictions, for the support of the holy life, thinking, “I will destroy old feelings & not create new feelings. Thus I will maintain myself, be blameless, and live in comfort.”’ “When the monk is one who eats for the right reasons… the Tathāgata then trains him further:<br/>
<br/>
‘(4)Come, monk. Be one who is devoted to wakefulness. During the day, sitting & walking back & forth, cleanse your mind of any obstructive states. During the first watch of the night, sitting & walking back & forth, cleanse your mind of any obstructive states. During the second watch of the night, reclining on your right side, take up the lion’s posture, one foot placed on top of the other, mindful, alert, with your mind set on getting up [either as soon as you awaken or at a particular time]. During the last watch of the night, sitting & walking back & forth, cleanse your mind of any obstructive states.’<br/>
<br/>
“When the monk is one who is devoted to wakefulness/vigilance… the Tathāgata then trains him further:<br/>
<br/>
‘(5)Come, monk. Be one who is possessed of mindfulness & awareness. When going forward & returning, make yourself aware. When looking toward & looking away.… When bending & extending your limbs.… When carrying your outer cloak, upper robe, & bowl.… When eating, drinking, chewing, & tasting.… When urinating & defecating.… When walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, & remaining silent, make yourself aware.’<br/>
<br/>
“When the monk is one who is possessed of mindfulness & awareness… The Tathāgata then trains him further:<br/>
<br/>
‘(6)Come, monk. Seek out a secluded dwelling: a wilderness, the shade of a tree, a mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a forest grove, the open air, a heap of straw.’<br/>
<br/>
“He seeks out a secluded dwelling: a wilderness, the shade of a tree, a mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a forest grove, the open air, a heap of straw. After his meal, returning from his alms round, he sits down, crosses his legs, holds his body upright, and brings mindfulness to the fore.<br/>
<br/>
“(7)Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world, he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness. He cleanses his mind of covetousness. Abandoning ill will & anger, he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will, sympathetic to the welfare of all living beings. He cleanses his mind of ill will & anger. Abandoning sloth & drowsiness, he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth & drowsiness, mindful, alert, percipient of light. He cleanses his mind of sloth & drowsiness. Abandoning restlessness & anxiety, he dwells undisturbed, his mind inwardly stilled. He cleanses his mind of restlessness & anxiety. Abandoning uncertainty, he dwells having crossed over uncertainty, with no perplexity with regard to skillful qualities. He cleanses his mind of uncertainty.<br/>
<br/>
“(8)Having abandoned these five hindrances—imperfections of awareness that weaken discernment—then, quite secluded from sense desire, secluded from unskillful things, he enters & remains in the first jhāna: joy & pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought & evaluation… the second jhāna...the third jhāna, the fourth jhāna: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain.”

**Ajahn Nyanamoli:** That's the 'technique.' The technique of basically overcoming _the_ addiction of the addictions - i.e. the addiction of the senses - without replacements. People can often replace it, committing to something else, even more activity, work, perpetual distraction, company - which would keep the mind away from actually seeking sense pleasures on a course level, but without uprooting anything. It is just like a heroin addict finding something else to keep his mind addicted to, which is not dealing with it. The moment those activities become unavailable, the resting place of his mind is where his addiction still is, so he will go back to that which he hasn't uprooted.

So that is what ‘meditation’ is - once you have sufficiently, wholesomely disturbed your mind by unwavering sense restraint, seclusion, guarding of the sense doors - now you learn to calm within that. Not abandon it, but calm; still the agitation aspect of it, so that you can carry on, because you realise that that's the way out.

<blockquote class="english">
“The Blessed One said, "Monks, do you develop mindfulness of in-&-out breathing?"
When this was said, Ven. Arittha replied to the Blessed One, "I develop mindfulness of in-&-out breathing, lord."<br/>
<br/>
"But how do you develop mindfulness of in-&-out breathing, Arittha?"<br/>
<br/>
"Having abandoned sensual desire for past sensual pleasures, lord, having done away with sensual desire for future sensual pleasures, and having thoroughly subdued perceptions of irritation with regard to internal & external events, I breathe in mindfully and breathe out mindfully." 
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="reference">

</blockquote>

[There is no specific instruction that can be given on how to do this, because] that would become another activity you will now _do_. The only way to do it is to endure it, and through that endurance, when you have no room to move left, right, forward or backward, you will find the way to calm yourself - BY not moving left, right, forward or backward.

That's also why you cannot accidentally become enlightened - who would accidentally become free from addiction through enduring the pain of withdrawal for six months? Without a reason, without a determined goal to go through that and do that work? Who would accidentally somehow just choose to do that for so long that they then become free? There has to be some knowledge, and some will behind it, to commit to that training and see benefit in it. Again - cigarettes, alcohol, heroin, all are particular addictions, _within_ sensuality. Now you are giving up the entire domain of pleasure that is based on activity through the senses.

**The only way to overcome such addiction to sensuality is by gradual training.**

Gradual training means developing a wide base of virtue, a wide base of sense restraint, eating for the right reasons, and watchfulness. Then all the struggles that your mind will go through from that supreme withdrawal, you can calm within that without falling from that wide base.

That is why from the point of view of developing your mind, it is actually better to start by keeping even the five precepts, but taking them _for the rest of your life_. The five precepts for the rest of your life is what would start to become that 'wide base' - and it has to be done in that sense. A heroin addict will not free himself if he goes to rehab only on the weekends and then continues as normal throughout the week. So take on the five precepts - forever. That is already going to be a confinement for the mind that is addicted to chasing sense pleasures - and that's the weight you need to start taking on in the gradual training, it's the whole point. That's what the lay followers in suttas did:

<blockquote class="english">
“We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the sangha of monks. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” 
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="reference">
– MN 150
</blockquote>

It means that five precepts are now the basis of your sense restraint and confinement, which is very easy, not even really confining - but they must be taken in the ultimate sense. Then, if on top of that you want to sometimes keep the eight precepts, good; but then if you don't keep the eight precepts there is no falling lower than the five precepts, that is your basis. And that must remain your basis.

Then, if you do really want to free yourself once and for all, or at least make an attempt for it, then you should take the eight precepts - again, in the ultimate sense, _for the rest of your life._

Through that, because now that's something you must protect, you're forced to be mindful. You're forced to be moderate and not overdo things that would make you spill out and break the precepts. You're forced to guard your senses; because if you don't, it becomes very unpleasant in the confinement of the eight precepts. That's how you start taming your mind.

**MN 125 - Taming the wild elephant simile:**

<blockquote class="english">
“Suppose, Aggivessana, that a king addresses his woodsman, ‘Come, my good woodsman. Mount a royal elephant, enter the woods, and when you find a wilderness elephant, bind it by the neck to the royal elephant.’<br/>
<br/>
“Responding, ‘Yes, your majesty,’ the woodsman mounts a royal elephant, enters the woods and, finding a wilderness elephant, binds it by the neck to the royal elephant. Then the royal elephant leads it out into the open air. It’s to this extent that the wilderness elephant has come into the open air, for wilderness elephants long for
the woods. “Then the woodsman informs the king, ‘Your majesty, the wilderness elephant has come into the open air.’<br/>
<br/>
“The king then addresses his elephant tamer, ‘Come, my good elephant tamer. Tame the wilderness elephant. Break it of its wilderness habits, its wilderness memories and intentions, its distraction, fatigue, and fever over leaving the wilderness. Make it enjoy the town and teach it habits congenial to human beings.’<br/>
<br/>
“Responding, ‘Yes, your majesty,’ the elephant tamer then plants a large post in the ground and binds the wilderness elephant to it by the neck in order to break it of its wilderness habits, its wilderness memories and resolves, its distraction, fatigue, and fever over leaving the wilderness, to make it delight in the town and to teach it habits congenial to human beings.<br/>
<br/>
“The elephant tamer then speaks to the wilderness elephant words that are soothing, pleasing to the ear, affectionate, that go to the heart, that are polite, appealing and pleasing to people at large. When the wilderness elephant is spoken to with words that are soothing, pleasing to the ear, affectionate, that go to the heart, that are
polite, appealing & pleasing to people at large, it listens, lends ear, and exerts its mind to understand. The elephant tamer then further rewards it with grass, fodder, and water. When the wilderness elephant accepts the elephant tamer’s grass, fodder, and water, that’s when the elephant tamer knows, ‘Now the wilderness elephant will live!’<br/>
<br/>
“Then the elephant tamer makes the wilderness elephant perform further tasks: ‘Pick this up, sir. Put this down, sir.’ When the wilderness elephant obeys the elephant tamer’s instructions to pick up and put down as it is told, the elephant tamer makes it perform further tasks: ‘Go forward. Go back.’ When the wilderness elephant obeys
the elephant tamer’s instructions to go forward and go back as it is told, the elephant tamer makes it perform further tasks: ‘Get up. Lie down.’<br/>
<br/>
“When the wilderness elephant obeys the elephant tamer’s instructions to get up and lie down as it is told, the elephant tamer makes it perform a further task called immovability. The elephant tamer ties a giant shield to its trunk. A man with a lance in his hand sits on its neck. Men with lances in their hands stand surrounding it
on all sides, while the elephant tamer, with a long lance pole in his hand, stands in front of it. As it is made to perform the task of immovability, it doesn’t move its forefeet or its hind feet, it doesn’t move its forequarters or its hindquarters, it doesn’t move its head, it doesn’t move its ears, it doesn’t move its tusks, it doesn’t move its
tail, it doesn’t move its trunk. It is a royal elephant that endures attacks from spears, swords, arrows, and axes; and resounding beats of drums, cymbals, conchs, and tom-toms. Rid of all faults and defects, purged of flaws, it is worthy of the king….”
</blockquote>

**Ajahn Nyanamoli:** So you're not just seeking a pleasant experience to replace the other one, you are uprooting all of it. So that's 'meditation.' Calming amidst that. When there is withdrawal, the wild mind still kicks and screams, and now you are calming it _without_ abandoning withdrawal, _without_ giving in to the senses, _without_ letting the elephant go back to the jungle to have a break.

Then there is no going back - [which is the very meaning of] 'non-return'. One who abandons sensuality is _not coming back to this world_, for that very reason. He has abandoned dependence on anything from this world. It is not a poetic name, ‘non-return’, but factual. He is never returning to any previous addiction, it's inconceivable - like a stone split in half cannot be drawn together, irreversible. If you accomplish ‘going against the grain’, going against samsara, it's irreversible, you can't go back down, impossible. That's why the free mind is known as 'free mind.'

**Q:** _An alcoholic might not drink for ten years, but could still go back…_

**Ajahn Nyanamoli:** Yes, because they haven't uprooted their view of sensuality. But even in that sense, you can get a glimpse of the same principle. Suppose you free yourself from that addiction to cigarettes for example - then you go back to cigarettes and it is sickening. It would take a lot of effort to work through that
and become addicted again. And it's kind of impossible for you to now go through that work carelessly, knowing what you have been through, when you have truly freed yourself from the addiction of it.

[In the same way,] having fully uprooted the view of sensuality, fully understood the danger of it, it's just impossible for the mind to even entertain that as a possibility anymore. Literally that elephant, you dragged out of the forest to train it, and now that elephant has finally understood, for himself, the peril of going back there. Now you can unhook it, you can remove all the straps, it will not go back there because it was actually unpleasant and always was. Sensuality is only relatively pleasant because of your mental condition, the addiction to it, the need to scratch the itch.

Would the leper who is free from his condition, even consider burning himself with that ember from before, that would cause immense pain, unbearable pain? When the reason that was making it provide him with that relative pleasure is gone, it just becomes inconceivable for him to do that.

<blockquote class="english">
“Suppose, Māgandiya, there was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails, cauterising his body over a burning charcoal pit. Then his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives, brought a physician to treat him. The physician would make medicine for him, and by means of that medicine the man would be cured of his leprosy and would become well and happy, independent, master of himself, able to go where he likes. Then two strong men would seize him by both arms and drag him towards a burning charcoal pit. What do you think,
Māgandiya? Would that man twist his body this way and that?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes, Master Gotama. Why is that? Because that fire is indeed painful to touch, hot, and scorching.”<br/>
<br/>
“What do you think, Māgandiya? Is it only now that that fire is painful to touch, hot, and scorching, or previously too was that fire painful to touch, hot, and scorching?”<br/>
<br/>
“Master Gotama, that fire is now painful to touch, hot, and scorching, and previously too that fire was painful to touch, hot, and scorching. For when that man was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails, his faculties were impaired; thus, though the fire was actually painful to touch, he acquired a mistaken perception of it as pleasant.”<br/>
<br/>
“So too, Māgandiya, in the past sensual pleasures were painful to touch, hot, and scorching; in the future sensual pleasures will be painful to touch, hot, and scorching; and now at present sensual pleasures are painful to touch, hot, and scorching. But these beings who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures, who are devoured by craving for sensual pleasures, who burn with fever for sensual pleasures, have faculties that are impaired; thus, though sensual pleasures are actually painful to touch, they acquire a mistaken perception of them as pleasant.”

Stilling of *sankhāras* equates to samadhi, so practically, how would
you then convey what *sankhāras* are? It\'s an important term, so how
can you make it not so abstract? Most translations we find are not very
practical, for example, when it\'s translated as 'determinations', you
might ask yourself: "How do I calm determinations? Do I just refrain
from determining anything? How am I even determining things, etc." There
are some even more ambiguous translations such as 'mental formations' or
'energies', etc. But if we look at what is common to
body-*kāya-sankhāras*, speech-*vacī-sankhāras* or mind-citta- or
mano-sankhāras, what we find is that those things are movements,
intentions, directions, pressures, forms of 'activities/activations' in
the broadest sense of the term.

So how to be free from *sankhāras*? How to still all activities? It\'s
not just about not doing anything to be free from *sankhāras* because
abstaining from doing is your doing, that is also an activity. It\'s
about seeing the relationship between wholesome activities and not going
into unwholesome activities, and then fundamentally removing a
particular aspect from activities - the activity of ownership, which is
the root of all problems, and that\'s exactly what the gradual training
is all about. The first few steps- (1) keeping the precepts and (2)
guarding the senses doors, are for the reducing of unwholesome
activities; (3) Moderate in eating and (4) watchfulness - the activities
that you do carefully; (5) Seclusion - not distracting yourself with
work, talk, or company, i.e. moderating activities that you don\'t have
to do unless they are necessary. You are still active in seclusion, you
move around, you intend, clean, plan, etc, but now the background of
those activities can become more obvious, more discernible because you
are not distracted by coarser activities and that\'s exactly how you can
begin to discern and still the fundamental activity based on ignorance,
that of taking things as mine, taking things as belonging to me. The
Buddha called it "*ahaṅkāra and mamaṅkāra*"- I making and mine making.

> "When, Sāriputta, a bhikkhu has no I-making, mine-making, and

> -- AN 3.33

'Mine-making' is not 'I chose to make this mine', it\'s on the level of
being conscious towards things as if they are yours, including your
'self', so it is of course a subtle *sankhāra*, but if you have been
practising the gradual training, it will be the most obvious thing. You
take things as 'mine', that\'s why 'you' are, it\'s not the other way
round. The activities, paired with ignorance, are there and that\'s why
you have a sense of self which you take as your own. Usually one thinks:
'I am first', 'I am active', 'I am inactive', "I am" equals things that
are mine or not- mine. However, 'Things are assumed to be yours first'
and that\'s already an activity, an assumption which assumes 'I am'.
Activities are already there and you are already taking them implicitly
as 'towards you', 'for you', and that\'s why you have a sense of self.
That sense of self, which is real as such, is dependent on that
assumption of "for me" or \" this is mine\", thus it is not-MY-self.

The removal of that assumption of ownership in regard to the activities,
that you can only discern on account of withdrawing yourself from every
single unwholesome activity of body, speech and mind, i.e. the gradual
training, is peaceful, is sublime, is the stilling of all activities,
the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving,
dispassion, cessation, *nibbāna*. When there is no *avijja* in regard to
*sankhāras*, then sankhāras cease and the activities that are left are
the activities on account of this conscious body and all external
significances/things.

<u>**Right order, and non-delight in masculinity/femininity**</u>

> -- [AN 7.51](https://suttacentral.net/an7.51)

**Ajahn Nyanamoli:** The first thing you would notice there is that it
is not about denying masculinity or femininity. It is about not
carelessly becoming dependent upon the pleasures of the masculine body
or the pleasures of the feminine body, which then results in seeking the
external counterpart. So the whole point is to become developed in
regard to your own body. It's not about saying "there is no gender, this
masculinity is just an illusion." Yes, in a sense, there is no gender as
in no gender that is yours, that can be owned by you - but factually,
the body is so. It is such - with such hormones, with such
predispositions, such height and shape and so on - and that's not a
problem.

The problem is that there is a basis of pleasure that can arise on
account of the body and your mind is not developed in regard to that. So
when the prospect of pleasure makes itself apparent, you are accepting
the body and accepting the ownership. You are carelessly identifying and
taking up the ownership of whatever you are paired with - in this case,
the masculine aspects. As a result, you seek pleasure even further
outside, which is the counterpart for it. Again as a result of that, you
seek the union and become dependent on the pleasure of the union and
everything else; all the burdens that come with it.

All this is because you were not developed in regard to the initial
prospect of pleasure that you were paired with. The body, whether
masculine or feminine is the basis of a certain type of physical
pleasure, for a man it is the basis of his masculinity, for a woman it
is the basis of her femininity. And why is that prospect of pleasure not
enough in itself? Why by default does an undeveloped mind seek the
external counterpart? Why would you spill outside and seek union with
the external?

It's because of a view. Because of the assumption of where the pleasure
of a sensual kind is, that the pleasure is in the external sense
objects, not on the level of your body. In the same sense that people
assume that *they* are accessing, seeing, perceiving, and owning the
external objects; not that it is their senses seeing, perceiving, and
owning.

In other words, your senses, your body, masculinity, or femininity; is
invisible to you, because you have been carelessly cultivating actions
towards that pleasure *out there*, which is also factual but is actually
secondary to the pressure of the body, sense objects are secondary to
the existence of the *patigha* (resistance-pressure) of your senses. The
only reason you don't see that is because you keep assuming. You keep
holding the view that *that* \[out there\] is first, and this \[body
here\] is second. So \[in the eyes of the assumption\] this \[I\] gets
attracted to *that* \[out there\] because of that \[out there.\] Thus,
whatever is *here* is seen as second, and as insufficient. That is why
you are not developed in regard to the body because you assume the wrong
order, and the wrong order prevents the development.

But if you see: "Well, it doesn't matter how far out I reach and seek,
the experience is bound within the framework of these senses. The only
way I can know the external world is on account of these senses knowing
the external world. This means that, for me, the assumption I had of the
external world is actually pretty much inconceivable"...If then, you
start thinking about it clearly, you realize all that was a complete
misconception. All your assuming is internal to your senses, and that is
all you can have.

But you will not be able to reach the basic level of this clarity if you
are *still* acting on account of the assumption of the external coming
first. And your body, your desire, the pressure being second - as just a
response to the impulse. For as long as you keep that picture perverted,
there is no development, there is no uprooting of sensuality, and there
is no abandoning of masculinity or femininity.

> "And at that time Venerable Vaṅgīsa became dissatisfied, as lust
> infected his mind. Then he addressed Ānanda in verse: "I am burning
> with sensual desire; My mind is on fire! Please, out of compassion,
> Gotama, tell me how to quench the flames."

> [SN 8.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn8.4/en/sujato?layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)

**Nm:** Perversion of the order, means literally, putting that which is
second as first.

**Q:** So what is first?

**Nm:** What is first is the framework of your senses, there is no
outside of it, you are fully enclosed within it. You start recognizing
that, and you will start experiencing deep anxiety because you realize
you are utterly, utterly enclosed - trapped - within yourself. And any
notion of the external world or external pleasure - it is not that it is
"not real" - it's real, but it's also enclosed with you, it's within.
\[It's almost like a sense of being\] 'buried alive' as we spoke before.

That's why underlying tendencies just push you in the direction of
sensuality because if you resist it you are left with deep fear, pain,
and terror. Your assumption is of the external world, and suddenly you
see that it doesn't matter the extent of the universe you travel, it's
within this body as the Buddha would say:

> Once I was a seer named Rohitassa, a student of Bhoja, a powerful
> sky-walker. My speed was as fast as that of a strong
> archer---well-trained, a practiced hand, a practiced
> sharp-shooter---shooting a light arrow across the shadow of a palm
> tree. My stride stretched as far as the east sea is from the west. To
> me, endowed with such speed, such a stride, there came the desire: 'I
> will go traveling to the end of the world.' I---with a
> one-hundred-year life, a one-hundred-year span---spent one hundred
> years traveling---apart from the time spent on eating, drinking,
> chewing & tasting, urinating & defecating, and sleeping to fight off
> weariness---but without reaching the end of the world I died along the
> way. So it is amazing, lord, and awesome, how well that has been said
> by the Blessed One: 'I tell you, friend, that it is not possible by
> traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the world where one
> does not take birth, age, die, pass away, or reappear.'"
>
> (When this was said, the Blessed One responded:) "I tell you, friend,
> that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end
> of the world where one does not take birth, age, die, pass away, or
> reappear. But at the same time, I tell you that there is no making an
> end to suffering & stress without reaching the end of the world. Yet
> it is just within this fathom-long body, with its perception &
> intellect, that I declare that there is the world, the origination of
> the world, the cessation of the world, and the path of practice
> leading to the cessation of the world."

> -- [AN 4.45](https://suttacentral.net/an4.45/en/thanissaro?reference=none&highlight=false)

When you actually take that in a realistic sense it is quite frightening
for a mind that is not developed, for a mind that is still dependent on
the pleasures of the external kind.

**Q:** You can't reach beyond your senses.

**Nm:** It's inconceivable, your thoughts can't even fathom the outside
of it. The only way to do so is to misconceive it. And then through
misconceiving, that misconception "exists" as such. That's why the
Buddha said the form "finds footing" in existence, through
misconceiving:

> "Mendicant, this is not how the question should be asked: "Sir, where
> do these four primary elements cease without anything left over,
> namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?"
>
> This is how the question should be asked: "Where do water and earth,
> fire and air find no footing?"

> -- DN 11

So it exists then as external, although it can't - by not knowing that
that is how it exists for you. That's the fundamental perversion of the
order. Sensuality is that, *bhava* is that. So seeing that your senses
come first - (and you can only see that if you have not been acting out
of them if you have been withdrawn from that pressuring addiction of
scratching the itch by external means) - when you see that, you start
seeing that there is no outside of this, and even your thoughts of
"outside"- it's not that you stop having them, you just see them
correctly, as "within this."

So the clearer that becomes, the lesser the perversion you are living on
a day-to-day basis, so to speak. Up to the point where the perversion
would become completely eradicated - doesn't matter what you see, hear,
smell, taste, touch, or think, you cannot fall back into the assumption
of the wrong order, because the right order has been thoroughly
understood, such that the perversion can't take place any more. And
that's when you know you're free from *kamabhava*, from sensual craving
and sensual being. The pleasure of the external kind was not the
sensuality, it was because of the perversion of the order that the
sensuality was there.

That's exactly what that sutta (AN 7.51) describes - through not being
developed in regard to what comes first - for a man it's the masculine
framework of the body and the senses; for a woman, it's the feminine
framework of the body and the senses - you start spilling outside,
assuming outside, becoming even more dependent on the outside.

**Q:** "Not being developed" means...?

**Nm:** Not seeing it clearly enough; not having practiced sense
restraint; not having your mind developed in regard to the pressure, not
having endured it patiently long enough, having been acting out of it.
Or, having been keeping the precepts as a means of external duty, not as
a means of direct development of your mind by not acting out of the
pressure of the current sense. All of that is "not being developed in
regard to your own masculinity or femininity." It means taking up the
ownership of that, not being able to see it as impersonal, as *anicca*,
as *'other'*

**Q:** So he gives in, and delights in his masculine pressure.

**Nm:** You could just say "He takes his masculine pressure for
granted." By default, his mind is already outside, attracted to those
things, even if he is avoiding them. Because of taking the pressure for
granted as "mine," as belonging to me, not having a mind developed in
regard to that pressure, means the pressure will overwhelm the mind, the
mind will not overwhelm the pressure. By default that will put you
outside.

What needs to be sustained is not acting out of that pressure, but
discerning it, and guarding the sense doors. That does not mean just "I
keep the precepts because it's my duty" but rather intentionally
choosing to abstain from thinking about things that would be taking up
the pressure; intentionally keeping an eye on your actions, decisions,
on your choices, and responsibility behind in such a way that will make
you *not* spill out towards the external world.

By sustaining this sufficiently you are becoming aware of what it is
that you've been doing, that has been perpetuating your dependence on
the pressure and the pleasure of the external world. Which is taking the
pressure for granted, as yours. So you start allowing it to be, not
trying to get rid of it so that you can endure it correctly, not act out
of it correctly, and guard your sense doors in regard to it correctly.
This means that you are taking up responsibility for it, and so you are
not taking it for granted anymore.

Eventually, then you will be able to see it as not yours. It's not that
now you need to just "see it as not mine." It is by not acting out of
it, guarding your sense doors, taking responsibility for it, allowing it
to endure, and not trying to get rid of it - all of these are ways of
practicing \[towards\] "not mine." When that is sufficiently cultivated,
then that whole perverted order on account of taking up the pressure as
mine would have faded or would have diminished sufficiently for you to
see that it has diminished.

<u>**Correct practice of Asubha vs *sīlabbataparāmāso***</u>

**Q:** There is an idea that one practices in such a way: "I have lust
for a woman. So now I must contemplate the disgusting nature of a
woman's body." \[or the opposite.\]

**Nm:** See, the problem with that is that it is taking it in the sense
of an external duty that one must do. "When lust is present, I must do
*this*." No - When lust is present you must acknowledge it, and
recognize the mind of lust as the mind of lust. As opposed to - "Mind of
lust - \[I immediately turn away from it and\] do this. The mind of
non-lust - I do that. Either way, I will try to not be aware of myself
because it's too unpleasant." So when the mind of lust is there, that
needs to be endured.

If you are jumping into the practice of *"asubha"* immediately, you are
acting out of it. You are not allowing it to be for what it is - the
phenomenon of lust, mind affected by lust - you're just trying to get
rid of it. Which is exactly the motion of sensuality - when lust is
present you immediately jump into the sensuality to get rid of that
painful itch. So now you learn that this is bad, and now you go "when
lust is present what do I do?" And you jump into acting out \[in another
way\] *still to get rid of that painful itch*.

Those are the two extremes that people end up going towards, by not
understanding the middle way: either scratch the itch or try to deny the
itch. People's practice of *asubha* often falls on the level of just
trying to deny the itch. That is not *asubha*, it is not uprooting of
the lust, it's just managing it. It is not even good management, because
it will come back, and the *"asubha"* will lose effectiveness the more
you do it rooted in wrong reasons.

So the mind of lust is present; then the first thing you know is "okay,
I should not act out of this. But I should do *asubha* - when the mind
of lust is NOT present." Otherwise, your practice of *asubha* is rooted
in lust, trying to deny the lust. And why would you try to deny the
lust? Because you don't want to endure it. The first step of patient
endurance is what you do not even want to do. So all the subsequent
steps are based on *sīlabbataparāmāso* - avoiding responsibility for the
first step of patiently enduring it, not trying to get rid of it.

> "Patient endurance is the ultimate austerity.\
> Nibbana is the ultimate, say the Buddhas.\
> No true renunciate is violent or hostile to an other"

> -- [Dhp 184](https://suttacentral.net/dhp179-196/en/sujato?layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)

**Q:** Again, you have the underlying tendency towards lust, whereas
lust is not exactly active now but one can still see that one is liable
to lust. So now I can contemplate *asubha*.

**Nm:** Exactly, so there is no "mind of lust" actively present, but if
I ask "am I free from lust? Well..." So now you should contemplate and
try to redefine the framework of attractive by seeing it as
unattractive, create a broader context of unattractive - because that is
there. Just you haven't been looking at those aspects. But you can only
do that right when the mind is properly established; i.e. when you are
not rooted in trying to get rid of things, that lazy avoidance of
endurance.

Q: Properly established means "being able to patiently endure."

Nm: To have not acted out of it, so that you are not gripped by lust.
And in that frame of mind, you can contemplate - contemplate the
*asubha*, contemplate the danger, all of these things. Then when the
'activated' lust comes back, you wouldn't need to be asking "oh, what do
I do now?" Because if you had sufficiently contemplated the nature of
that which is lustful, it will be implicit in that lust.

So that which was lustful comes now with an even richer background of
"unattractive" because that is what you have been cultivating. It's
about rewriting the significance of things. Through that significance of
lust, there is also seen the further significance of danger,
unattractive, not worthy, to be avoided, to be not acted upon. And the
clearer that broader context becomes, the more impossible it would be
for you to put that superficial aspect of lust first and ignore all the
context as secondary. In other words, your mind is becoming
imperturbable in regard to lust because that context is becoming
established and it's not moving. It doesn't matter how forceful, how
quick, or how sharp the lust might be, the context remains first. That
is when the mind is settled in the right order, and it cannot tip over
anymore.

**Q:** Some might want to contemplate the disgusting nature of *another
person's* body. Is it not better to look at this body, your body?

**Nm:** Well, first, if you are doing it based on a mind that is not
affected by lust at the time, you can do it either internally or
externally; it doesn't matter. If you do it externally your body will be
included in that contemplation; if you do it internally other's bodies
will be included in that - as long as it is not done based on lust and
trying to avoid the endurance of a mind of lust or any other unwholesome
hindrance.

> -- [AN 7.51](https://suttacentral.net/an7.51)

**Nm:** "not delighting" is about not taking it for granted. The
pressure, the possibilities of pleasure that your masculine form offers
you, you need to practice non-interest, non-zeal towards those. Do not
take them for granted but actually start contemplating and regarding
them as perilous. That's basically not using your body for the sake of
gaining external pleasures...

**Q:** That you can never gain.

**Nm:** You can never gain them because it is already a perverted order,
but if you don't understand that, then you would be established, based
upon, dependent upon the form that you have; masculine or feminine. You
took it for granted, took ownership of it. That's the root of all the
beautification, the anxiety you have if it gets sick, the suffering of
the senses failing, all of that is on the level of when you already took
it for granted.

So you cannot just say "I will un-take it" - or "I will just let go of
it" -it's not a matter of direct choice. But what you can do is first,
stop acting out of the form being taken for granted; i.e. stop acting
towards external pleasures, start practicing sense restraint, endure
your senses and their own patigha, endure the pressure, and try to see
it as impersonal as possible.

Then if you become more accustomed to this, (which is what *samadhi* is,
basically - being unmoved, by having sufficiently endured it)- that is,
more accustomed to the interior of your senses (which is all you ever
had, there is no "exterior" to your own experience, it's a contradiction
in terms) then, being accustomed to this, stop resisting it, you can see
it as simply "a thing there."

So it doesn't mean "I need to become feminine in order to overcome my
masculinity" or vice versa, no - that's just you acting out of whatever
you have, trying to deny it with the opposite. All you need to do is
stop taking it for granted and stop assuming ownership of it.

<u>**Opening amidst confinement and practice of *jhana***</u>

> "This was said, friend, by the young deva Pañcālacaṇḍa:\
> "'The sage, the withdrawn chief bull, the Buddha who has understood
> jhāna, the One of Broad Wisdom has found the opening amid
> confinement.' "What, friend, has the Blessed One spoken of as

>

> enters and remains in the first jhana. To this extent the Buddha spoke
> of creating an opening amid confinement in a qualified sense...."

> -- [AN 9.42](https://suttacentral.net/an9.42)

**Nm:** The opening is not finding another direction apart from the
senses, or denial of the senses. The "opening amidst confinement" is the
removal of the ownership of that which confines you. Complete
non-appropriation - which begins with the first *jhana*.

So it's not like you find the opening in the aggregates by which you can
sort of "slip out" of samsara. No, you *are* confined by everything that
appears. *Nama-rupa paccaya vinnana. Vinnana paccaya nama-rupa* - that
is the ultimate confinement. So what is, then, the "opening" amidst
that, the opening within already being fully buried alive - it is the
removal of the ownership of that situation in its entirety. That's why
in the first *jhana* there is no sense of "I am" as in "I am entering
the first *jhana*". It's not that there is no sense of the five senses -
there is, but there's no ownership of it. There are [thoughts and
thinking]{.underline}, but the traces of ownership have been completely
removed on every level. Thus, nobody is confined; there is no
confinement anymore. For something to be confined, you need that which
confines and that one which is confined, the assumed sense of self.
Complete removal of that ownership and conceit is the subtlest of the
openings, so to speak, amidst everything that confines.

**Q:** That's why it says that the first *jhana* is an opening, that
escape - but now, as the sutta continues to state, could one see that
there is still confinement there?

**Nm:** Yes, but now it is getting abstract. If a person develops the
first *jhana* they will understand what is the true *okāsā* (opening)
among *sambādhe* (confinement) then the principle of other *jhanas* will
become apparent. But if somebody tries to understand this \[on an
abstract level\] "This opening and this confinement, then this further
opening and this confinement" - none of that will become applicable.

The opening, the escape, from that which confines, is the removal,
uprooting, and fading away of ownership and conceit in regard to the
senses and their pleasure that you have been depending on. That's why
the first *jhana* is enough for arahantship. If you establish your mind
upon that first escape and spend a sufficient amount of time in it, you
will have uprooted any lust towards anything that was confining you
before. But yes, theoretically speaking, one who is established in the
first jhana can start thinking about whether there is a more refined
opening or escape in regard to this. From the point of view of the
second *jhana*, the first is very coarse; from the point of view of the
third *jhana*, the second is very coarse, and so on.

So you can use that principle to *remove the ownership*. *Jhana* in
itself does not necessarily bring the full uprooting of the sense of "I
am" and the sense of "mine." For that you need wisdom. Theoretically, a
person could have *jhanas* without having fully uprooted their
underlying tendencies.

**Q:** So here I am with a pressure of the body, and I want to satisfy
it, get rid of that pressure, and feel pleasure rather than this
pressure.

**Nm:** Why is that? What is the burden? It is confinement, you are
confined by this pressure, so what do you do? You try to get rid of the
pressure by spilling out, letting it outside. That's why you won't find
the true opening amidst confinement because you keep acting towards the
assumed "opening." The sense pleasures of the external kind are the
assumed relief of the pressure here. And that's why people are so
psychologically dependent on "scratching the itch." That is the only
form of release that they know.

But it is not a release - it's the very reason for your confinement.

The more you try to find release in that way, the more burdened you
become, the more dependent on sensuality you become. That's why it's
important to realize that this needs to be lived on the level of
enduring the pressure, not acting out of it, and calming your mind
within it. Withdrawal from the dependence on the pleasure of the assumed
external kind is the prerequisite for that pleasure of *jhana*, that
genuine release.

> -- DN 10

Withdrawing from unwholesome, from the wrong order that you have been
assuming, that is the work, and the release of the right kind will occur
as a result of it. That's the true "opening amidst confinement." But
people don't want to deal with the confinement. They don't want to deal
with the pressure or endure it - they want a technique that will give
them an experience of pleasure that they will then take to be *jhana*,
and then assume that all this work has been done, on account of this
special meditation pleasure that they had. That is exactly mirroring the
same principle of the sensuality that you have been acting out of. You
are still seeking that pleasant thing to be your escape. No - the escape
is found by not being, not maintaining, the dependence upon the wrong
order. Then the pleasure of *jhana* will happen:

> "Quite withdrawn from sense pleasures, withdrawn from unwholesome
> states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is accompanied
> by thought and thinking and filled with the joy and happiness born of
> withdrawal."

It does not say: "Not having been withdrawn, still being pressured by
sensuality, he gets a technique, he experiences jhana and all his
problems just falls away, and it's a magical experience."

**Q:** What is the difference between desire- *chanda* and craving-
*tanha*?

**Nyanamoli:** The difference is that *chanda*-desire is a form of zeal,
interest, and it can be either wholesome or unwholesome. If you have a
desire towards sensuality, that is *kamachanda*-sensual desire, which is
not a wholesome desire. So then if you want to be free from sensuality
because you started to understand the dissatisfaction of it, then you
can have a desire to be free from it, to be free from sensuality and
sensual desire. It\'s still a form of desire that can make you want to
practice the Dhamma. It\'s a desire that can eventual y result in
freedom from sensual desire. *Chanda* is not in itself bad, nor good, it
just depends on where you direct it. It\'s not a question of not having
desires as you begin to practice. It\'s really about having the desires
that are directed at the development of the wholesome and the
diminishing of the unwholesome.

When you are free from any desire towards sensuality and so on, you will
also lose the desire towards the wholesome because that is now what you
are. At that point, you don\'t need to have a desire to develop the
wholesome once that wholesome is developed. That\'s how desire, directed
rightly, can result in freedom from desire all together, freedom from
*chanda* all together.

Abandoning unskilful desire is not a matter of choice, it\'s a matter of
directing it towards a certain kind of behaviour, that kind being the
[*gradual training*,](https://suttacentral.net/mn125) which will then
remove any basis for perpetuation of unskilful desire later on.

In other words, when you become aware of your illness, you need to have
a desire to be cured. That desire will make you look for a doctor, find
the right medicine, and then sustain the application of the medicine on
the basis of desire for health. And then once you\'re cured, and healed,
and there is absolutely not even the slightest trace of your illness
left, you will have no more desire to be cured because you\'re cured.
However, if while you\'re ill and you think, "Okay, so being free from
illness means having no desire to be cured, thus, I will have no desire
to be cured", that way of thinking will prevent you from curing
yourself.

In the beginning, a person cannot distinguish between bad or good
desire. That\'s why you need to start with sense restraint, as we always
say. But you don\'t want to be trying to not have desires. You want to
be trying to see where your desires are directed. And if it\'s a desire
for physical pleasures, of the lustful kind. That\'s a desire you should
not cultivate, that\'s the desire you should abandon, not welcome, not
entertain, endure until it passes without acting out of it.

An *anagami,* who is free from sensual desire, is not free from
*chanda*. He\'s free from desire towards the sense objects of pleasures.
In other words, freedom from sensuality doesn\'t mean absence of
*chanda* of any kind, it means loss of interest and zeal for the sensual
type of pleasure. Why? Because the gratification has been fully
understood, the danger has been fully understood and the escape has been
fully understood.

> actually is, the gratification of sensuality as gratification, the

> -- [MN 13](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.013.than.html)

It\'s not that an *anagami* or an *arahant* have no concept anymore of
what physical pleasure would feel like, it\'s that they have no interest
in it anymore on the level of the mind, intent or thought. They\'re
absolutely free from any zeal that a person not free from sensuality
would otherwise have. An untrained person who has a sensual thought, is
immediately pressured to act out of that thought and pursue sensual
pleasures, because there exists an inclination towards it, there is a
welcoming of that prospect of pleasure, the possibility of
gratification.

That inclination can only be abandoned through seeing the danger of that
delighting towards sense objects.

You will not have an interest in ingesting poison if you understood the
deadliness of the poison. Even though the texture and taste of it
hasn\'t changed, the pleasure hasn\'t changed, but your understanding
now of seeing it as a poison, that has changed, and so you have
absolutely no zeal towards that kind of pleasure whatsoever. You have no
interest in it.

**Q:** A person might say, "Well, I understand that sensuality is bad.
Yet, I\'m still attracted."

**Nm:** For as long as you haven\'t fully understood the gratification,
the danger and the escape, you will still value sensuality, which means
that you should not claim that you understood sensuality. Because if you
do make such a statement, that means you\'re contradicting yourself. If
you fully understood those three aspects, there would be no *chanda*
towards sensuality left, there would only be *chanda* towards
renunciation, towards seclusion, towards further abandonment.

A person might think, "Yes, I understand the peril of sensuality". Okay,
fine. Ask yourself the next question.

"So am I free from any form of delight, welcoming, zeal, interest,
curiosity even towards pleasures that come on account of objects of the
senses that are provocative of lust?". "No, I don\'t think I\'m free of
that. Or I\'m not sure if I\'m free that.", that means you\'re not free
of that, that means that you should not think you understood it, and
that you need to make more of an effort in the direction of
understanding.

Nobody denies that you will have some insight or some degree of insight
into sensuality once you start restraining, but don\'t think that\'s
freedom until you know, "I am free. I don\'t want this, this is truly
something I have no interest in anymore, quite the opposite".

You might spend most of your day not having interest in sensual
pursuits, but are you still liable to having interest in sensual
pursuits? If so, you\'re not outside of the domain of sensual desire.

You always want to look at that level of *liability*, "Am I liable to
become careless and interested in sensual pursuits again? Well ,
maybe?". Well , there you go, you\'re not free from doubt in regard to
it, which means you\'re not free from it.

As for *tanha*, it\'s subtler than *chanda*. *Tanha* is on a different
level. *Chanda* is kind of an active quality that you either carelessly
engage with on account of your past behaviour that hasn\'t been
restrained, or something you can cultivate, as the Buddha would say, \"
he generates desire... for the sake of the non-arising of evil,
unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen...\".

You can reflect on why it\'s good to be cured, why it\'s good to make
the effort towards abandoning the unwholesome and cultivating the
wholesome, why it\'s good to practice the gradual training, why it\'s
good to be virtuous and sense restraint, and because of those
reflections you will be generating a desire to develop those practices.

*Tanha* is more on an immediate level of your attitude towards your
present enduring feeling, whatever it is.

That attitude is always rooted in *resistance*. If there is craving for
pleasure, that is rooted in you resisting the current feeling, which is
not necessarily unpleasant, but it\'s not sufficient, i.e. the pleasure,
it\'s not sufficient, which is why you crave for more pleasure. Which
means, it\'s painful.

Any resistance is painful, and with the mind of resistance, if you
experience pleasure, you will by default be resisting it, because by
default, you want more of it. With the mind not free from *tanha*, when
you experience pain, by default you\'re resisting it, because you don\'t
want any of it. You want it to completely go away. With the mind not
free from *tanha*, when you experience a neutral feeling, you will
automatically resist it, you will incline towards oblivion, towards
ignoring it, towards turning away from it, because you don\'t understand
it. *Tanha,* practical y speaking, is always that resistance on the
level of what you\'re currently feeling.

**Q:** Even if you\'re feeling pleasure, you\'re still resisting it.
It\'s not good enough for you.

**Nm:** Absolutely. That\'s why if you\'re not free from craving, every
pleasure will be underlined by craving for more. With the presence of
resistance, there is the presence of dissatisfaction, presence of
*tanha* means *dukkha* is there, presence of *dukkha* means *tanha* is
there.

If *tanha* is still present, that means that there is still resistance
to whatever feeling is there for you at the time, and that\'s why you
suffer, not because of what is felt but because of that resistance. And
why would you be resisting? Why is it that you\'re not content with an
agreeable feeling that is present? Why is it, that by default, the mind
wants more of it? It\'s because of the wrong view in regard to what
pleasure is, what sensuality is, what gratification is. Sensuality is a
form of *upadana*, an assumption, it\'s a view, it\'s basically the
values that you uphold throughout your day to day existence.

Sensual desire is felt unpleasantly and that\'s why you want to gratify
your senses, because non-gratified senses hurt. However, your resistance
is the suffering there, and so if you stop resisting the non gratified
senses, they\'l stop hurting and there will be no suffering there
despite the senses being gratified.

You don\'t see that the suffering is on the level of your *resistance*.
You think suffering exists because there is no gratification of the
senses, and so you go out and seek gratification, and that\'s why you
keep perpetuating your suffering.

First, you need to stop seeking out the gratification of the senses. So
that your *resistance* to the non-gratified senses becomes apparent as
the cause of your suffering. And then you realise, "Oh, I stop
resisting. It stops hurting". Which means that gratifying the senses
becomes redundant.

The habit of resistance (craving) perpetuates the sensuality view that
non-gratified senses cause suffering and gratified senses means freedom
from suffering.

*Tanha* feeds *kāmupādāna-* the assumption of sense desire, and the
*kāmupādāna* feeds *tanha*, that\'s why it\'s beginningless. It\'s a
vicious circle, it has no beginning. It\'s not that you were pure, then
you develop *tanha*, and then you develop *upadana*. No, you start
already infected, perverted, mistaken, confused, assumed.

Corruption is beginningless. And that\'s why if you understand it, if
you uproot the gratuitous assumption or the craving, both will be
uprooted and cannot revert back. The uprooting is irreversible.

## 247hh- Discerning The Body For Uprooting Of Sensuality

***

The reason why a person\'s mind would still be dependent on the pleasure
of the senses despite knowing how little satisfaction they provide or
how much danger they entail, is fundamentally because they do not really
know where the problem is. You can know that the pleasures that you
get from the sense objects are not satisfactory but you still don\'t
understand the extent of the sense objects, you don\'t understand the
extent of the pleasure that you are chasing. In other words, when you
think about the dissatisfactory nature of the sense objects, that is not
entirely accurate because if it were, then you would understand the
danger and lose desire towards it. The problem with still being
attracted towards that which you know does not result in happiness but
instead in doing you more harm than good, the problem of you still being
addicted to the pleasures of the senses is that you don\'t see where
that pleasure begins, you only see what you are used to seeing on the
level of the sense objects but there is more to that picture that is
left out because of which your addiction is not uprooted, and that which
is left out is the relationship with you and your body.

When there is a sensual pull towards sense objects for pleasure, at the
same time, your body and senses are there peripherally enduring as a
basis from which you are pressured. The relationship, on that peripheral
level, between you and that body that is pressuring you towards sense
objects, that\'s what needs to be understood. The reason why that is so
hard to understand is because the body as a unity of sense organs does
not and cannot appear on the level of sense objects. Your dependence on
the pleasures of the sense objects is determined by and dependent upon
the pressure that your body exerts on your mind. It is a wild animal
that you are tied to, it\'s inseparable from your mind, and it wants to
go left and right and eat this and that, and it will pressure you until
it gets what it wants.

It\'s not about removing the agreeable and enticing things from the
world to be free, it\'s about taming that which pressures you because of
which you are not free. That\'s why you are still attracted to sense
objects despite knowing how little satisfaction sense objects provide.
Your knowledge that "This is dissatisfactory" is limited and pertains
only within the sense objects and you are failing to see the bigger
picture of this whole underlying pressure of your own body and the
pleasure that you depend on. You are failing to see the wild animal
underneath. You don\'t see that as a problem, you only think that the
sense objects that you become obsessed about, are the problem. No,
that\'s pretty much the end result of the problem already being there
and fully controlling you. That\'s why sense restraint - not engaging in
these sense objects that are inciting of lust, etc, is the prerequisite
which will help you to see the roots of the problem, which is the body,
the senses, that are attracted to the pleasure that they are used to, to
those unwholesome pleasures that you have been carelessly feeding them.

If you don\'t engage with the pleasures that they are used to, their
dependence on that will cease because they haven\'t been engaging with
it. If the animal is engaged in a perpetual wild behaviour it will
become used to that and that\'s going to be its norm, but if the animal
is not allowed to engage with these sense objects which are provocative
of lust and aversion, it will calm down whether it wants to or not
because things of the agitating nature are now things that the animal
has not been engaging with. If you want to uproot the dependence on the
pleasure of the sense objects, you have to uproot the dependence on the
pleasure of this body, its agreeability, your assumption of ownership,
and not seeing it peripherally as a thing which endures there on its
own, with its own thirsts.

You need to disown the body but that can only be done on the level of
that correct peripheral recognition of what the body is. It cannot be
done on the level of observing the body with your senses because you are
not observing the body, you are observing the sense objects which
require the body, and even if you are super attentive to every sensation
that occurs, that\'s all on the level of sense objects and that\'s why
none of that which is underneath it, which is that necessary requirement
for perceiving the sense object, none of that will be affected by that
practise and by those efforts. In the same sense that an eye cannot see
itself, for as long as you believe that you can, you will be engaged in
an extremely futile attempt of trying to access that which is
inaccessible, i.e. trying to access your sense organs on the level of
sense objects, which is a contradiction in terms. You need to
see/discern the body on the level of the senses, on the level of the
framework of the world of the sense objects, and that will fully purify
the relationship between you and the body that appears peripherally
while you are experiencing sense objects. 

For as long as you have sense objects, the body, the unity of the sense
organs, is peripheral to that. It\'s always the background to the domain
of the sense objects and that\'s where you need to discern it. It\'s not
about examining the individual organs and looking at it with other sense
organs, it\'s about understanding the six sense base, the body as that
thing which is there that needs to be tamed on that level of the
peripheral. Through not engaging with sense objects that are pulling
you, that pressure that the body exerts over you will diminish and the
clearer you will see it on that level which is revealed through sense
restraint. The more you get used to it, the less pressure there will be,
the body will be seen correctly and any possibility of pleasure to be
accessed or experienced through that body will not be something that
will interest your mind, because the mind would see the extent of the
danger if it chooses to go in that direction.

So just to summarise, the first thing you want to do is, if you want to
stop chasing the sense pleasures, you start practising mindfulness of
the body correctly, not as an observational technique of watching
sensations, but by seeing it peripherally as an enduring bag of skin
which contains the sense organs that are attracted to the various sense
pleasures, that they get in their respective domains. You want to learn
to discern the body as it is, as a thing in the world on the level of
the peripheral, without trying to attend to it directly, which is
impossible. You will get to see that body peripherally, if you have been
practising sense restraint sufficiently, guarding of the sense doors,
being moderate in eating, watchful and dwelling in solitude - because
company and the world requires your mind to be on the level of sense
objects, and if you have not been sufficiently withdrawn from that, then
there is not enough space for you to step back and get to see this body
as a thing that endures there in the world as a basis for all the sense
object experiences. You will not be able to see the relationship between
the two.

Now when you have been sufficiently withdrawn in this way, you can then
disown the pressure and pull of those individual organs, you can see
them as five individual animals, like the simile that the Buddha gave.
You can see them as wild animals that need training. People who are not
withdrawn from the sense objects, see 'the animals' only in abstraction,
which means that they do not see them. They don\'t see their sense organ
as an independent entity which pretty much has its own life,
desires/needs, that they need to tame and control. So each time there is
a pull from a sense object, then they are the ones that are pulled by
sense objects, they don\'t see anything in between because those sense
organs, those animals, do not appear on the level of sense objects that
you are so used to looking at and measuring your existence by. That\'s
why there is the encouragement for the practice of sense restraint and
correct mindfulness, for discerning those peripheral signs and features
of that body which exist on the level of 'around that which you are
attending to', that\'s what the body is.

That\'s also what the Buddha meant when speaking about knowing the [body
to the extent necessary for final
knowledge](https://suttacentral.net/mn10). The measure of that extent is
how familiar you are with the phenomenon of the body on the level of the
peripheral, how steady your mind is in discerning the presence of the
body for what it is on its own without trying to attend to it directly,
without trying to make it a sense object. If you can discern that extent
sufficiently then you will no longer be underlied by lust, craving and
thirst of the individual senses.

By not discerning the senses and by being on the level of sense objects
that\'s how you are underlined by all the asavas. They underlie you
because you go over them, and then they direct and push you. So you want
to develop your mind to the extent necessary where you are not
[underlied by them](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.56), but when you
underlie them, so to speak. Like in one sutta where it says that the
arahants mind is not overwhelmed by things, by pressures, he is the one
who [overwhelms them](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.243). That is what
is meant by establishing the right order, seeing what comes first,
seeing the body on the level of the peripheral, as that which is first
and not losing that context, despite what happens with your individual
attention. So whatever you are attending to, whatever pressure there is,
desire for pleasure and so on, the order that is now determined by your
knowledge, now does not change, you still see that peripheral body as
the basis for all of this that is happening, and all you need to do is
protect that order so that there is no room to become underlied by lust,
aversion, distraction, which is the perverted order.

Practice that sufficiently and lust, aversion, distraction will
completely fade because they have not been maintained through the
perversion of the order. That\'s why Ven. Ananda said that "Sensuality
is a perversion of perception", i.e. putting the sense objects first and
everything else measured through that as second, and not seeing the body
peripherally, the necessary basis for sense organs as that which is
first, structurally speaking. If you un-pervert that perception there is
then no room for lust to breed and expand
