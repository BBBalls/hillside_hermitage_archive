<h3 id="feelings-are-suffering">Feelings are Suffering</h3>
<p>How should one free oneself from suffering?</p>
<p>The very first step that one should make is to learn how not to
<em>crave</em> the cessation of suffering. At first glance this might
seem simple, but actually it is not so straightforward at all; for we
cannot assume that an untrained, ordinary person even knows what truly
suffering is.</p>
<p>In order to know <em>dukkha</em> it is not enough just to suffer. To
know <em>dukkha</em>, one has to recognize, within the present
experience, what <em>is</em> and what <em>is not</em> necessary. The
point is that, in the experience of pain, certain aspects are
inevitable, while others, are not. In different words – the
‘painfulness’ of pain is suffering and not the pain itself.</p>
<p>Let me get back to the opening statement that one should not crave
the cessation of suffering; why is that essential? The <em>immediate
reason</em> of our suffering, as the Buddha tells us, is our craving or
<em>taṇha</em>. It is because of <em>taṇha</em> that our experience of
pain is <em>painful</em>. This applies to the other two kinds of feeling
too. Thus, we can say, that it is because of craving that
<em>feelings</em> are <em>dukkha</em>. In the first type, unpleasant
feeling, craving for the <em>cessation</em> of that feeling causes one
to suffer: the painful feeling is present there, directly opposed to
one’s desire for it to not-be, to disappear. In this way a discrepancy
is created, a discrepancy which is nothing but <em>dukkha</em>. In the
second type, pleasant feeling, craving for <em>more</em> of that feeling
is manifested, thus the <em>actual</em> pleasant feeling appears as
unpleasant, when attended from the direction of that increased pleasure
which is <em>craved for</em>. The present feeling of pleasure becomes
inadequate, a lack which needs to be satisfied. Again, the discrepancy
arises, which one tries to overcome by a further pursuit of various
things in the world which, will <em>intensify</em> his pleasure further.
One hopes that such attempt will ‘fill the gap’ within, but needless to
say, that is impossible since the discrepancy is actually being
constantly <em>generated</em> by the presence of <em>taṇha</em>, and
<em>not</em> by the various objects in the world.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Thought and lust are a man’s sensuality,<br />
Not the various things in the world;<br />
Thought and lust are a man’s sensuality,<br />
The various things just stand there in the world;<br />
But the wise get rid of desire therein.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>– AN VI 63 / iii, 411</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When it comes to third type, neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feelings
(i.e. neutral), suffering is experienced as a result of one craving
<em>for feelings</em> themselves, since neutral feeling is not
recognized at all:</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Neutral feeling is pleasant when known [as such],<br />
and unpleasant when not-known [as such]”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>– MN 44 / i, 303</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, to summarize, one’s experience of pain is <em>not</em> the reason
for one’s suffering. It is rather the presence of craving, in one’s
experience, that suffering <em>is there</em>. As long as this remains
the case, one will be a “victim” of one’s own feelings, be they
pleasant, unpleasant or neutral.</p>
<h3 id="existence-means-control">Existence Means Control</h3>
<p>In order for something to exist (<em>bhava</em>), in order for it to
be, in a full and appropriated sense, that thing has to be given first,
in the form of an experience as a whole. When I say ‘given’, this should
be understood in the sense that we can only “find” things as already
being there, in the world. (Cf. Sartre’s statement in <em>Being &amp;
Nothingness</em> that every thing comes <em>with</em> past). The fact is
that things can only be found when they are attended to and this means
that – fundamentally speaking – they are <em>beyond</em> one’s control<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>: one is not their <em>creator</em>.
Thus, one’s experience as a whole <em>cannot</em> be controlled; the
most a person can do is to modify an already given state of affairs, on
a more particular level.</p>
<p>Take the five-aggregates as an example: their nature is to appear,
disappear, and change while standing, at <em>their own accord</em>. It
is only with <em>upādāna</em> that this characteristic is obscured<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and in such cases the apparent Self
becomes the fundamental agent of the process instead, or at least this
is how it appears to a <em>puthujjana</em>. One who is not free from
<em>upādāna</em>, and the Self-view, confuses the fact that the
five-aggregates (or in this case the five-holding-aggregates)
<em>can</em> be modified or affected once they arise, with the notion
that they are controlled. This notion of control also supports (or
feeds) the view that ‘Self’ is their creator, which in return feeds that
notion, and so on indefinitely. This is why with ‘Self’ there comes the
perception of <em>mastery</em> over one’s experience – <em>“Attā</em>,
‘self’, is fundamentally a notion of <em>mastery over things</em>.”
(Ñāṇavīra Thera, <em>Notes on Dhamma</em>, DHAMMA)</p>
<p>The Self then, as a “master”, appears as something different,
something <em>apart</em> from the five-holding-aggregates. Furthermore,
the Self keeps finding proof for its existence by constantly interfering
and modifying (when possible) the arisen states of the
five-holding-aggregates. The Self finds pleasure in doing so.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the Self would see that, despite all of the
proof, its mastery actually <em>requires</em> (or <em>directly
depends</em> upon) the five-aggregates, the notion of control would
cease<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. It becomes clear that ‘Self’ cannot
possibly exercise any fundamental control over their appearing,
disappearing, and change while standing. This is why by contemplating
this long enough, one can become an <em>arahat</em>:</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Then, monks, at another time the Buddha Vipassī dwelt contemplating
the appearing and disappearing of the five-holding-aggregates… And as he
remained contemplating the appearing and disappearing of the
five-holding-aggregates, before long his mind was freed from the fetters
without remainder.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="with-birth-death-applies">With birth, Death applies</h3>
<p>1. We are born. We come into this world through our birth. As we
shall see in the following paragraphs, there are many ways that one
<em>can</em> think of one’s birth. However, from a phenomenological
point of view our birth is always here <em>with</em> us. The fact that
one is constantly engaged with the world of one’s desires, decisions and
miseries, means that one is born – his birth is <em>present</em>.
Obviously, for someone not used to thinking phenomenologically, it might
be fairly difficult to pull oneself out of the habitual way of regarding
things as something which is clearly defined, something palpable in
one’s experience. For such a person ‘birth’ <em>is</em> an event from
the past, and we shall address this issue in the paragraphs to follow.
However, there is also a simpler and easily overlooked reason for one
failing to grasp the phenomenological description of ‘birth’. In our
language the term ‘birth’, as a designation of experience, carries
certain <em>past</em> connotations. These connotations are absolutely
gratuitous, and we shall see that the reason for that lies in people’s
<em>views</em> (<em>diṭṭhi</em>). The established usage of terminology
draws its significance (i.e. the meaning of its words) from the most
<em>common</em> views (on the level of humanity or a particular
culture), about the nature of experience. Needless to say, the common
views are rarely correct, especially when it comes to the experience of
an individual. These views can never represent the real <em>order of
things</em>. Thus, apart from the way we speak, and use the language,
nothing requires us to think that birth can, and shall <em>only</em> be
understood as a past event which has started and ended <em>in</em>
time.</p>
<p>2. Naturally, it is possible for one to regard, and understand to a
certain extent, birth as something which has happened to him a long time
ago, even without having the actual memory of the event. However, this
kind of limited understanding is only possible in the <em>objective</em>
(scientific) <em>view</em> of the world, and oneself. We can even go a
step further and say that it is precisely <em>because</em> of that view
that one thinks of birth (and other things, including ageing-and-death)
in these temporal categories. With this kind of view, the objective
world in front of one, the world which is <em>in</em> time, takes
precedence over one’s experience as such, which is <em>of</em> time
(cf. Ñāṇavīra Thera, <em>Notes on Dhamma</em>, FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURE,
Dynamic Aspect, para. 5). One starts regarding the objects that appear
<em>through</em> one’s experience, as something more fundamental than
the experience itself – he puts second that which is to come first, and
he puts first that which is to come second<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. As
a result of this one starts regarding oneself objectively as also being
<em>in</em> time. Thus, time develops into a category which has become
<em>external</em> to everything, and all of the things appear as being
“within” it<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Therefore, one sees that others are
born, their event of birth occurs in time, when he observes it
externally. But because he views himself externally too, he naturally
(i.e. in conformity with his view) comes to assume that his birth has
<em>also</em> occurred some time ago in the past. One also assumes,
since he can see it in his everyday experience, that death <em>will</em>
happen to him in that same ‘external’ sense, “as it happens to others
all the time”. By regarding things in this way, he, as an individual,
does not feel threatened by any of it, until the <em>actual</em> death
comes of course. So, we can see that one doesn’t adopt this objective
view voluntarily – when <em>avijjā</em> is present, the view is
developed naturally as the quickest way of offering one assurance from a
threatening world. The world and one’s experience becomes explainable
and measurable – one has regained <em>control</em>.</p>
<p>Let us get back to the phenomenon of ‘birth’, we were discussing. The
Buddha referred to ‘birth’ as: “Whatever birth, taking birth, descent,
coming-to-being, coming-forth, manifestation of aggregates, and
acquisition of [sense] spheres of the various beings in this or that
group of beings, that is called birth.” (Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta, M. 9/i
50)</p>
<p>Thus, although we can agree that birth is some sort of a “beginning”,
so to speak, a “manifestation of the aggregates”, what obliges us to
think that that beginning has <em>ended</em> there? The fact that one
keeps accepting and using the five-aggregates, the fact that one is
constantly involved with the world of one’s senses, doesn’t that mean
that one’s <em>manifestation</em> of aggregates is <em>present</em><a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>? And would one be able to desire
various things in the world, if those things were not manifested? If one
were able to relinquish any attachment for his own body, would one be
bothered when that body falls apart and dies? It is because one
<em>affirms</em> that manifestation of the five-aggregates, through
desire-and-lust for them, that the manifestation <em>exists,</em> it
comes-into-being – with being, birth is (<em>bhavapaccayā jāti</em>).
And when one regards it as ‘mine’, one ages, falls sick and dies (and
also experiences any other misery possible in this life) – with birth,
ageing-and-death (<em>jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇaṃ</em>…). If there is no
being whatsoever, would manifestation be able to manifest itself? And if
nothing manifested, would one be able to appropriate it? And if there is
nothing which belongs to one, would one suffer on account of those
things breaking up and disappearing? No, because one has escaped.</p>
<p>3. Let us go back to the question of when birth ends. Actually, we
can even ask when does birth start? The common view is that first one is
conceived, and than, after nine months or so, things culminate in one
being born. But when does the conception take place or when
<em>exactly</em> is one born? Is it with the formation of an embryo or
with cutting of the umbilical cord? Generally, the accepted view is that
birth is over when the baby comes out of the womb and into the world.
And when it comes to ‘general views’, we all know that people often tend
to blindly comply to them, taking them for granted for the most (or
whole) of their lives, without even realizing they are doing so. In this
case, ‘birth’ becomes that which accords to the majority of opinions on
that subject. One chooses to conform with “what everyone else thinks”,
since the majority is “always in the right”. One accepts Heidegger’s
impersonal ‘They’ as a dictator of one’s own values, one finds
<em>safety</em> in doing so. However, no matter how secure the
majority’s view might seem, all it takes is for someone else to come
along and say (perhaps supporting it with “the latest medical research”)
that birth actually ends when the formation of an infant is completed in
the womb, and that coming out of the mother is not relevant as such, to
question of birth itself. (Though, for parents, even if they happen to
be those scientists, this is probably <em>the most</em> relevant part<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>.) If his utterance manages to change
the general opinion, if the majority of people come to accept it, we
will have a new, “more accurate” view on the nature of birth. The
majority might have been wrong earlier, but now it is in the right…
until it changes. And one can again choose to conform to that majority
and make a choice out of it, but no matter how far one goes that choice
will always remain <em>personal</em>, and as such, be on the level of
<em>an individual</em>. So, although one thinks what everybody else
does, one nevertheless remains <em>responsible</em> for that very
thinking. It becomes clear then that by choosing the majority’s opinion
on a certain subject (in this case ‘birth), out of ’faith’ in modern
science (or religion) perhaps, a person chooses <em>his</em>
<em>individual view</em> on given subject. So, by deciding to accept the
scientific explanation of birth, one decides that birth, for him, is
something observable, an event in the world. Thus, whether one is aware
of it or not, one is responsible for the <em>meaning</em> of things in
one’s experience. Even if we go further and say that we could pinpoint
the exact <em>moment</em> of birth<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>, when, for example,
conception takes place, and even if the whole of humanity, without an
exception, agreed upon it, nevertheless, this would not escape the
<em>nature</em> of ‘view’, and that is to be ‘imposed’ onto things in
one’s experience, while at the same time directly depending upon them.
In our case that would most likely be the ‘objective view’, which is of
course, based on personal preferences and inclinations<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>.
Thus, for a <em>puthujjana</em> coming-out-of-womb <em>is that</em>
which is birth. His birth <em>exists.</em></p>
<p>The Buddha, on the other hand, talks about the <em>nature</em> of
birth, as a phenomena (<em>dhamma</em>), in one’s experience. He does
not refer to birth as an occurrence in time, upon which even
<em>puthujjanas</em> cannot agree, and this can be seen from the usual
<em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em> (<em>p.s.</em>) description. In this
description, <em>jāti</em> refers to that ‘nature’ of birth and any
temporal events are completely irrelevant to it. If there is no ‘birth’
whatsoever, if there is no manifestation (as such) of the aggregates, a
<em>puthujjana</em> would not be able to regard any event (in this case
‘coming-out-of-womb’) as <em>his</em><a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
birth<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>. Thus, one doesn’t suffer on
account of birth as an event in the past, one suffers on account of the
<em>nature</em> of birth in the <em>present</em>. In <em>p.s.</em>
context, ‘birth’ structurally <em>precedes</em> ‘ageing-and-death’.
‘Ageing-and-death’ is not ‘birth’, but they wouldn’t be without it –
together they arise, together they cease. So, it is that with ‘birth’,
‘ageing-and-death’ (and ‘sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair’)
<em>apply</em>. Consequently, if we were to discuss
<em>jāramaraṇaṃ</em>, we could say that it is because ageing-and-death
is <em>present</em>, that one will age and die (and suffer) <em>in</em>
time. But, if one could manage, through an understanding of the Dhamma,
to free oneself from ‘being’ – to bring it to an end – ’ birth’ and
‘ageing-and-death’ would cease to exist for him: all of the temporal
occasions for suffering would cease to be <em>his</em> suffering, since
by not-being born, one doesn’t have the desire to interfere with them
any more – one is free.</p>
<p>5. Let me just say something more, for those who find it difficult to
accept that the existential (phenomenological) method<a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
can validly be applied to Dhamma. We can put aside Sartre, Heidegger and
those like them, and disregard what they have to say about birth.
However, even in that case, still, we need look no further than the
<em>p.s.</em> description in order to see what the Buddha meant by
‘birth’. In Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta, M. 9/i 50, it is said, as we already
referred to it earlier on:</p>
<p>When a noble disciple has thus understood birth, the origin of birth,
the cessation of birth, and the way leading to the cessation of birth…
he here and now makes an end of suffering. In that way too a noble
disciple is one of right view… and has arrived at this true Dhamma.</p>
<p>Thus, a Noble disciple, an <em>ariyasāvaka</em>, can by understanding
‘birth’, in the same sense that he would have understood the Four Noble
Truths – directly and timelessly – free oneself and become an
<em>arahat</em>. So, one may rightly ask now: would this be possible, if
‘birth’ were not already somehow <em>present</em><a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>,
as a phenomena, in our experience? How would one be able to understand
birth directly and without involving time? If one’s birth was indeed a
distant event, in some maternity ward perhaps, one’s fate would be
sealed according to the Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta, since the event of birth has
already passed and cannot possibly be understood directly. Fortunately,
one’s birth is not <em>in</em> the past, so one can, if one chooses to
follow the Buddha’s Teaching, cease to, in the present, regard ‘birth’
as his and by doing so remove himself from the domain of
ageing-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair. One can
escape.</p>
<h3 id="appearance-and-existence">Appearance and Existence</h3>
<p>For a <em>puthujjana</em> the world exists. He can perceive things in
that world, see them appear and disappear, he can see them changing. A
<em>puthujjana</em> can also affect his surroundings and modify things
according to own preferences, pursue the desirable experiences and avoid
the undesirable ones—the <em>puthujjana</em> is <em>involved</em>. This
‘involvement’ with things represents the very core of the
<em>puthujjana</em>’s ‘experience as a whole’. Most people spend the
majority of their lives obliviously absorbed in it, taking the course of
‘involvement’ for granted.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>It needs to be understood that these ‘objects’, which the
<em>puthujjana</em> is fundamentally involved with, are <em>things</em>
which his experience is inseparable from, for the simple virtue of being
<em>his experience of those things.</em> For this reason we have to
broaden the meaning of the term ‘things’, from usually denominating
‘objects’ in one’s surroundings, to include <em>any</em> experience
whatsoever that arises and can be discerned internally or externally
(whether it is ‘objects’, ‘tools’, emotions’ or ‘thoughts’). In that way
the term ‘things’ would correspond to what is meant by Pāli term
<em>‘dhamma’.</em> Thus, the experience of the <em>puthujjana’</em>s
everyday world, his possessions, his desires and fears, anxieties and
happiness are all <em>things</em> or <em>phenomena</em>. All these
phenomena are completely <em>unknown</em> in their <em>nature</em>. This
is why it is crucial for a <em>puthujjana</em> to recognize that a
nature of a thing <em>exists.</em> This existence is not ‘in’ the world
of the objects that are ready-to-hand, not ‘in’ his mind, not even
between the two—but, a thing exists as an <em>experience</em>. Strictly
speaking that’s all that can be truthfully said, without resorting to
presupposed theories, inductive observations and explanations of the
experience—the only thing that a <em>puthujjana</em> can know for
certain is that ‘there is an experience’. In this way it can be seen
that a thing <em>is,</em> its ‘being’ appears and things such as
pleasure, pain, emotional states, ideas, abstractions etc. that people
have in their everyday lives, are in this way all <em>real</em>, they
all come to exist as something that is there, that has
<em>appeared</em>. No matter how ordinary or extraordinary one’s
experience is or might be, whether it is common or unusual, that
experience exists <em>as such</em>. Even if one is going through the
most obscure, ambiguous states of one’s mind, those very states are
valid in their nature (as obscure, as ambiguous); whether they are
intimate and subjective or the most impersonal objective facts—they are
all <em>phenomena</em>, they constitute the experience as a whole (which
is also a <em>phenomenon</em>).</p>
<p>“We do not <em>know</em> what ‘Being’ means. But even if we ask,
‘What <em>is</em> “Being”?’, we keep within an understanding of the
‘is’, though we are unable to fix conceptually what that ‘is’ signifies.
We do not even know the horizon in terms of which that meaning is to be
grasped and fixed. <em>But this vague average understanding of
Being</em> <em>is still a Fact.</em></p>
<p>However much this understanding of Being (an understanding which is
already available to us) may fluctuate and grow dim, and border on mere
acquaintance with a word, its very indefiniteness is itself a positive
phenomenon which needs to be clarified.<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The same is to be said for the even more complex categories of the
<em>puthujjana’</em>s world, such as ‘actions’, ‘choices’, notions of
‘good’ and ‘bad’ and similar. They are not exempt from the
phenomenological nature of things. Good or bad, skilful or not, these
things <em>manifest</em> in one’s experience<em>,</em> and as such: they
are real.</p>
<p>A very common passage from the Suttas which describes that which is
known as the ‘mundane’ Right View:</p>
<div class="pali">
<blockquote>
<p>Atthi dinnaṃ, atthi yiṭṭhaṃ, atthi hutaṃ, atthi sukatadukkaṭānaṃ
kammānaṃ phalaṃ vipāko, atthi ayaṃ loko, atthi paro loko, atthi mātā,
atthi pitā, atthi sattā opapātikā, atthi loke samaṇabrāhmaṇā sammaggatā
sammāpaṭipannā ye imañca lokaṃ parañca lokaṃ sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā
pavedentī’ti</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“There is what is given and what is offered and what is sacrificed;
there is fruit and result of good and bad actions; there is this world
and the other world; there is mother and father; there are spontaneously
reborn beings; there are in the world good and virtuous recluses and
brahmins who have realised for themselves by direct knowledge and
declare this world and the other world.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>– (MN 117 / iii, 72)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This easily overlooked passage offers a very acute description of an
<em>authentic</em> attitude of a <em>puthujjana</em>—the attitude of
recognition and acknowledgment of the existence of things <em>as</em>
phenomena (“<em>there is…”)</em>. Someone might argue that one does not
necessarily see the spontaneously reborn beings for example, but the
point is that one should recognize the mere fact that there <em>could
be</em> spontaneously reborn beings—the <em>possibility</em> of
spontaneously reborn beings <em>exists</em> as such. And if one
recognizes the validity of the appearance and existence of that
possibility, an <em>expectation of the concrete proof</em> that can be
obtained only through <em>senses</em> (i.e. one needs to <em>see</em>
those beings) ceases to be relevant, in the same way that a view that a
thing exists only if it can be experienced through the senses ceases.
This attitude thus discloses the <em>priority</em> of the <em>phenomenal
nature of things</em> (of one’s experience), over any other view which
does not assert that priority. And it is because of this very lack of
the correct priority that these kinds of views are <em>wrong views</em>
(as far as freedom from suffering is concerned). Thus, whatever one’s
experience is, whichever shape it might take—big or small, important or
not, clear or ambiguous—that experience is <em>there</em> in its own
phenomenological form. This by no means implies that such experience is
necessarily understood, it simply means that it is recognized for what
it is, even if that is as”something-which-is-not-understood”. This kind
of ‘acknowledgement’ is the authenticity that we also find the
existential philosophers often referring to. Together with authenticity,
there comes the sense of the <em>fundamental responsibility</em> for
one’s own existence<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> which is a necessary prerequisite
for a <em>puthujjana’</em>s ‘mundane’ Right View)<a href="#fn17"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
(which can then lead further onwards toward the ‘supramundane’ Right
View—the view of the Path). The reason why this attitude is a necessary
prerequisite is because only with this attitude will a
<em>puthujjana</em> be able to <em>understand</em> that he <em>does not
understand,</em> and by doing so enable himself for understanding.”<a
href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> The problem is, however, that if a
common man denies that which is right in front of him in his day-to-day
living, he denies the basic principles of his own experience. In other
words he is denying the most immediate <em>appearance</em> of things.
This results in phenomena not being seen at all. As long as this
attitude persists that man is going to be deprived of the possibility of
understanding the nature of the experience and consequently the nature
of his own suffering. That man is <em>inauthentic</em>.<a href="#fn19"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
As the experience shows us this is all too easily done. All that is
required is to simply never question the face value of one’s views of
the world and the experience and to never look further from one’s
immediate absorption in things.</p>
<p>For inauthentic man, when he does think about the nature of his
experience and the world around him, his views would generally pertain
to a common notion of a <em>hidden reality</em> behind the everyday
world (either material or mental, depending on the direction his mind
takes). What is meant by this is that he simply <em>assumes</em> that
there is something <em>more</em> real or fundamental in relation to what
he is or can experience. Simply put, if he was to assume a ‘mental’ type
of reality, as something which underlies the present experience, he
would fall into (one of the forms of) <em>idealism</em>; alternatively,
if the reality was to have a more ‘material’ basis, he would fall into
some form of <em>materialism</em> (or <em>realism</em>).<a href="#fn20"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>
Either way, the <em>puthujjana</em> oscillates between the two.<a
href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>For example, in present times, a spiritual/mystical view of the
hidden ‘Reality’ (one’s ‘true Self’, or ‘universal consciousness’) would
be a form of idealism, while the very common and prevalent scientific
objectification of the experience would most certainly come under
materialism. These two can serve as the two prominent poles of the Wrong
View spectrum.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> These views differ from the Right
View because as they are focused on developing and providing
<em>explanations</em> of the nature of one’s experience, while failing
to see that fundamentally they are <em>derived from it</em>. No matter
how plausible and accurate a theory or an explanation of the origins and
nature of the experience is, the fact is that experience, as a
phenomenon, will always <em>have to</em> come <em>first</em>. This means
that the explanation cannot be applied <em>retrospectively</em> to
describe its own origin which is <em>simultaneously present.</em>
Nevertheless, by maintaining this contradiction (which is an
<em>assumption</em>) the actual <em>structural order</em> of the
experience is assumed <em>different</em>. And since that’s all a
<em>puthujjana</em> has in front of him, that <em>assumed nature</em> of
the experience <em>exists as such</em>. Because of this, the nature of a
wrong view is to provide a man with reasons and causes, which achieves
nothing except concealing and contradicting the notion of the immediate
appearance of things and one’s own existential responsibility. When
Reality is hidden behind the appearances, which are then no more than
‘illusory’, whatever a <em>puthujjana</em> does and whatever he feels
ceases to be <em>relevant</em>, even if it’s the most immediate and
personal suffering. If it isn’t irrelevant just yet, a person with this
kind of view will certainly strive in order to make it so by blending it
into the all-embracing view that the world is nothing more than
illusion, and as such whatever comes to be experienced in that world is
disregarded because it doesn’t belong to Reality. Consequently, by not
pertaining to Reality, the things in one’s environment can be ignored,
and one will feel justified in doing so. Thus, for a <em>puthujjana</em>
of this kind, things encountered in everyday life don’t fit into his
<em>view of</em> <em>reality</em>—they are dismissed, they are <em>not
understood</em>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> In the view of scientific
objectification on the other hand, the <em>puthujjana</em>’s actions are
neatly explained in terms of various collections of nerve impulses,
reflexes, genes, sensations and so on. In this case the significance of
one’s actions cannot extend beyond the threshold of the molecular
compounds of one’s body, which then serves as the <em>reason</em> (or
<em>excuse</em>) for the <em>puthujjana</em>’s desires, emotions,
concerns etc.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> In both types of views the
responsibility for the immediate intentions and decisions is abolished,
by way of being included in the mystical or molecular forms (for example
“God’s Will” or genetic “predispositions”)—which serve to explain one’s
world. In either case that responsibility is not <em>felt</em>, its
<em>nature</em> is <em>disowned</em>. (Might this perhaps be the
<em>real purpose</em> of these views?) Thus, the inauthenticity remains
for as long as there is a view which places itself <em>over</em> the
existence as such, as something which is more primordial in itself: the
Reality <em>behind</em> or <em>beneath</em> the appearance, the
molecular structure of the world, again—<em>beneath</em> the things in
the way we encounter them in the world. Consequently, things like ‘good’
or ‘bad’, ‘results’ (of one’s actions), ‘being reborn’, ‘sacrifice’,
‘other world’ and so on<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> have no place in one’s
experience.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> As such, they become very ambiguous
categories of one’s life, which an individual can choose to accept and
believe in, or perhaps reject according to his personal choice. (The
overall decline of morality in the world indicates which kind of choice
prevails.) In this way these things are pushed in the domain of religion
and ethics and regarded as ‘convictions’ and ‘observances’ that one can
follow if one pleases.</p>
<p>Thus, whenever the priority of existence is not recognized, the
<em>nature</em> of things is obscured. Clearly the practice of Dhamma is
then out of the question. Nevertheless, for a <em>puthujjana</em> the
possibility of seeing the structural priority of existence as a whole
over the particular instances his Self derives from it, still remains,
and only when he admits this, the real work can begin.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Appearance in Its Priority</em></strong></p>
<p>So, with the mystical view on one end, and the objective, scientific
one on the other, the recognition of one’s personal existence cannot
arise. Because of these inauthentic attitudes, which are nevertheless
<em>normal</em> attitudes of the <em>puthujjana</em>’s everyday life, it
would be correct to say that for him things don’t even <em>exist</em>,
in a correct sense of that word. Only with the development of the
rudimentary notions of authenticity, through the practice of mindfulness
and restraint and reflection, can a <em>puthujjana</em> begin to notice,
little by little, the nature of his experience as a
whole—<em>phenomena</em> can start to <em>appear</em>. It is only in
this way that one can understand what is meant by the ‘being’ of things,
which is nothing fundamentally different than the ‘being’ of myself.<a
href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Through the establishing of
authenticity a <em>puthujjana</em> can observe that things around him,
and his experience as a whole, appear and disappear. In the beginning it
seems like this is happening while his <em>sense of the experience as a
whole</em> stays <em>unchanged</em>. This ‘unchangedness’ holds priority
over the <em>puthujjana</em>’s experience, and that’s because in its
nature it presents itself as something which is remaining the
<em>same</em> or <em>independent</em> (i.e. unchanging) throughout the
appearance of things which comes and goes. It looks as if things that
appear are ‘included’ within that general non-changing sense of the
experience. The appearance of things —or, simply, things <em>belong</em>
to it. Although there is no concealed ‘Being’ behind that which appears
since the basic authenticity has been established, this nevertheless
results in the notion that fundamentally things <em>are</em>, and
<em>that is why</em> they appear. Thus, ‘Being’ is assumed to be an
ontological phenomenon that manifests itself <em>through</em> the
‘appearance’. One might not be able to find it apart from appearance,
but nevertheless, a <em>puthujjana</em> thinks—“things exist, that’s why
they can appear”. In this way one assumes the ontological priority of
existence over the appearance. Thus, a <em>puthujjana</em> places
‘being’ as that which is <em>first</em>. This type of priority of
‘being’, is the necessary basis for the <em>puthujjana</em>’s sense of
‘Self’. The notion of constancy, the unchanging nature of the experience
as a whole, the independence, is the “extra-temporal changeless
‘self”’<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> of the <em>puthujjana.</em> ‘(The
being of) Self’ is then the reason for things to appear <em>,</em>they
are appearing <em>for</em> it.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> This arrangement, this
<em>particular [dis]order</em> of things is also called:
<em>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em>.</p>
<p>If, presumably, a <em>puthujjana</em> wants to abandon this view,
which is the root of all suffering, the authentic pursuit must continue.
What he has to see is that this notion of ‘Self’, despite its
independent character, also <em>appears</em>. No matter how elusive or
ambiguous it might be—it has to be seen as such: as an elusive thing.
Only after this is it is possible for a <em>puthujjana</em> to see that
the order of things imposed by the presence of an assumed
‘extra-temporal’ phenomena in his experience is the <em>wrong
order</em>. Based on things’ appearance, and based on the sense of the
experience as a whole, there is no justifiable reason for him to assume
any primacy of the sense of unchangeability any longer. <em>There
is</em> ‘the sense of unchangeability’ and that too <em>appears</em>.
Thus, the unchanging ‘(sense of) being’ was, in a wholly gratuitous
manner, given priority over the appearance of things by being assumed as
something which does not appear. The reason for this was simply because
this notion of priority was never <em>noticed</em>.<a href="#fn30"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>
If a <em>puthujjana</em> sees this <em>existing</em> notion that
<em>appears</em>, (which is <em>that,</em> which is his ‘Self’), a sight
of inseparability between ‘existence’ and ‘appearance’ will emerge. If a
thing exists, that is because it appears; if it appears, that is it
exists. Neither the appearance nor existence can be discerned or
conceived without each other, and that is what is meant by “to be is to
be perceived”—<em>esse est percipi</em>. At this phase, the assumption
of a hidden reality <em>behind</em> the appearance is almost
inconceivable. The <em>puthujjana</em> understands that if anything is
to exist, it <em>has</em> <em>to</em> appear.<a href="#fn31"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, one’s authenticity grows. The attitude has undergone a
considerable change, from a <em>puthujjana</em> not even being aware of
his own existence, over the notion that things appear <em>because</em>
they exist, up to now, where ‘to appear’ and ‘to exist’ means just the
same. Although this is certainly far better than anything before,
nevertheless this attitude doesn’t quite yet free the
<em>puthujjana</em> from suffering. He has to continue, but this is as
far as he can go on his own. No matter how hard he tries to understand
the existence, any attempt to do so will throw him onto the appearance,
and <em>vice versa</em>—whenever he looks at the appearance all he is
going to see is the existence. In one way or another, the
<em>puthujjana</em> will not be able to prevent himself from falling
into a view that ‘appearance’ and ‘existence’ are the <em>same</em>,<a
href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> or—since the difference is
perceived between them—he might think that they are
<em>different</em>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> But then the ‘sameness’ is still
there, so perhaps they are <em>both-the-same-and-different</em>.
Consequently, he can negate the whole thing and think that they are
<em>neither-the-same-nor-different</em>. In either case, he remains
<em>ignorant</em> in regard to the two; he remains a
<em>puthujjana</em>. If he is to change this, he needs help from the
<em>outside</em>; it has to come to him <em>externally</em>. The
<em>puthujjana</em> is not able (i.e. it is structurally impossible) to
“step out” of his experience, and see his situation of
‘being-a-<em>puthujjana’</em> as a whole. No matter how far he steps
back, he carries his ignorance with him. Only coming across the Buddha’s
Teaching can offer him an <em>outside perspective</em> of himself, which
if cultivated can ’turn him’ into a non-<em>puthujjana</em>.<a
href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>The Teaching tells him that ‘existence’ cannot be conceived anywhere
<em>apart</em> <em>from</em> ‘appearance’, but also that it is
<em>not</em> ‘appearance’ as such; furthermore, and even more
importantly, it also tells him that ‘existence’ does not depend on
‘appearance’ directly, it depends on the ‘assumption’
(<em>upādāna</em>)<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> <em>in regard</em> <em>to</em> that
which appears,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> and this means nothing else then
that the appearance, for its appearing, <em>does not require</em>
existence at all—it is actually better <em>without</em> <em>it</em>.<a
href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<div class="pali">

<p>Thus this inquiry has passed ‘through’ the <em>puthujjana</em>’s
‘being’, which must not be either denied (dismissed) or justified
(explained), but established as a <em>phenomenon.</em> It was seen that
this phenomenon, far from being a reason because of which things appear,
actually depends on the <em>puthujjana’s assumption</em> in regard to
<em>that which appears</em>. In the beginning, the <em>puthujjana</em>’s
existence was a mere fact, of which he was barely aware and this fact
represented his thoroughly inauthentic Self. However, now his existence
has not only ‘appeared’ for him, it was seen that ‘existence’ cannot
even be conceived <em>without</em> that which appears. In this way the
roles were slowly reversed and the priority of existence over the
appearance of things has faded. Now, with the Buddha’s aid, a
<em>puthujjana</em> can further see that actually the existence is not
that which appears—it never was. It is the appearance that
<em>exists</em>, by him <em>assuming</em> it (or by being
<em>ignorant</em> in regard to it.) The existence, in order to be,
requires <em>maintaining</em> (hence <em>upādānapaccāya bhavo</em>). In
this way a new perspective has emerged on the relationship between
existence and appearance, which reveals that, initially, the
<em>puthujjana</em> had the whole picture upside-down. The further
pursuit of this principle would simply carry further right through the
center of <em>puthujjana</em>’s being (who at that point would cease to
be a <em>puthujjana</em>) and complete the ‘reversal’ of this inverted
experience of his, in the same manner as one would turn a sleeve
inside-out. At that point that <em>individual</em>’s Being would cease
without remainder.</p>
<h3 id="hierarchy-of-awareness">Hierarchy of Awareness</h3>
<p>The fundamental nature of our experience can be described as a
hierarchy, which Ven. Ñāṇavīra tried to explain in his FUNDAMENTAL
STRUCTURE (NoD). We are what we experience, it is not possible to view
(or imagine) this hierarchy from ‘outside’, independent of us, because
regardless of how far one steps back, one cannot abandon the experience
as such.</p>
<p>The experience, whether mundane or sublime, possesses certain
characteristics, and the most prominent among them is that it is
<em>hierarchically ordered</em>. This hierarchy goes into infinity in
both directions, and this is something which can be seen from the nature
of <em>particulars</em> and <em>generals</em>. If we take a look at our
own experience as it is, we can see that there are two aspects which
appear as being more pronounced than anything else. Those aspects are
known as <em>immediacy</em> and <em>reflexion</em>. Together they
comprise this hierarchy of the experience <em>as a whole</em>. Thus, the
hierarchy we have been referring to can be called <em>reflexive
hierarchy</em>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> If we want to be more precise we
can say that immediacy and reflexion, respectively, represent two
different modes of experiencing this hierarchy. In immediacy, reflexion
is not directly present; it is there, but placed in the background. In
reflexion, the immediate object is seen from an <em>additional point of
view</em>, which means that once we reflect upon something, immediacy
<em>does not</em> disappear, it rather becomes secondary to the field of
attention but, nevertheless, it remains there:</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“In immediate experience the thing is present; in reflexive
experience the thing is again present, but as implicit in a more general
thing. Thus in reflexion the thing is twice present, once immediately
and once reflexively. This is true of reflexion both in the loose sense
(as reflection or discursive thinking) and <em>a fortiori</em> in the
stricter sense (for the reason that reflection involves reflexion,
though not vice versa). See MANO and also VIÑÑĀṆA.” (NoD, ATTĀ (a))</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The presence of this reflexive hierarchy, as can be seen from
FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURE,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> generates another dimension to the
experience. This dimension is also hierarchically ordered, superimposed
upon the original reflexive one; dependent upon it, but at the same time
responsible for the existence of it. This simply means that their type
of dependence is not temporal, i.e. it does not occur in sequence. This
new hierarchy is the <em>hierarchy of awareness</em>, and although this
hierarchy cannot go ‘below’ the experience as such (awareness is always
awareness of something in-the-world), there is no limit for ascending
levels of this hierarchy. As the term ‘generating’ implies, with the
presence of reflexive hierarchy the hierarchy of awareness is also
present—<em>simultaneously</em>; and as was already said, the existence
of this hierarchy, makes the reflexion possible in the first place.</p>
<p>Let us try and say something more about the nature of
superimposition, which is relevant for these two hierarchies. When
things are <em>superimposed</em> they are not <em>directly</em> or
<em>linearly</em> related. They are simply <em>there</em>, next to each
other and any thought along the lines of <em>causality</em> distorts
them as they are.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> This superimposed way of existing
is nothing else than what is meant by being <em>akālika</em>, ‘timeless’
or ‘beyond time’. Two things are there, dependent, yet not directly
related to each other. That is the reason why we said that with the
presence of reflexive hierarchy there is the <em>presence</em> of the
hierarchy of awareness. This precedes any notions of causality or of
time. Nevertheless, if we still insist on describing their mutual
relationship, the most accurate way would be to simply say: with
reflexion, awareness <em>is</em>; without reflexion awareness <em>is
not</em>. This is clearly a reference to <em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em>
itself, so now would be the right time to say something more about
it.</p>
<p><em>Paṭiccasamuppāda</em> is <em>a principle of timeless
dependence</em>, i.e. existential superimposition. With the presence of
one thing the other thing is simultaneously present, too. Thus, it is
not possible to conceive or imagine <em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em> without
actually seeing it within the experience, simply because conceiving and
imagining, in its nature, <em>involves sequence</em> (i.e. it is linear
from the point of view of this new hierarchy, and as such pertains
solely to the reflexive hierarchy). So, although hierarchy of awareness
cannot go ‘under’ or ‘in front’ of the immediate-and-reflexive
experience, as we noted above, it can always come ‘closer’ than it is.<a
href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> The point is that these two
hierarchies <em>do not touch</em> or <em>overlap</em>, they are
<em>perpendicular</em>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> When we say ‘hierarchy of
awareness’, this should not be understood in a sense that one is always
aware. On the contrary, revealing this hierarchy requires effort, which
is being manifested through the practice of mindfulness. Nevertheless,
this hierarchy <em>exists</em>, and because of that the whole other
reflexive hierarchy is possible (see above). The difficulty lies in the
fact that this hierarchy cannot be <em>directly</em> grasped, and that
is because any notions of directionality originate from it.</p>
<p>The description made so far refers to the experience as a whole in an
<em>ideal</em> sense, i.e. the structure of experience has been
described and this structure is the same in <em>arahant</em> and
<em>puthujjana</em>. The difficulty is that the experience is, when we
reflect upon it, already affected with ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>).
Ultimately, ignorance is nothing but the <em>non-seeing</em> of the
nature of superimposition of the two hierarchies. Things are further
complicated by the fact that even reflexive hierarchy is not a simple
order of different levels of generality of things; even in this
hierarchy, those levels are, in a way, superimposed in relation to each
other, and they are all ‘kept together’, so to speak, by the fact that
they can all be <em>attended</em> to from the perspective of the
hierarchy of awareness. This hierarchy unifies them, determines them or
‘keeps them together’. Here we can recognize the nature of determination
(<em>saṅkhāra</em>), which, as the Suttas tell us, exist through the
presence of ignorance (<em>avijjāpaccayā saṅkhāra</em>). Thus, when one
is not free from igorance, the nature of the hierarchy of awareness is
not understood and because of that, that hierarchy will be implicitly
taken <em>par value</em>, as a kind of owner-creator of the reflexive
one, i.e. of our experience. This hierarchy of awareness appears as
being <em>towards</em> the reflexive hierarchy, as if ‘pressing’ in the
direction of it.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> Simply by not-seeing that it is
directly dependent upon the reflexive hierarchy, this ‘pressing’ of the
hierarchy of awareness is being followed at its face value, and one
comes to <em>assume and accept</em> that offered ownership over one’s
own experience,<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>, i.e. one comes to assume that
there actually <em>is</em> Self.</p>
<p>This is perhaps overly-simplified. As we said earlier on, the
reflexive hierarchy generates the presence of the hierarchy of
awareness. This in return, simultaneously determines reflexive hierarchy
as such. However, since there is no first moment of ignorance being
manifested, both of those hierarchies are affected by it, through and
through. The hierarchy of awareness appears as somehow ‘in between’ our
reflexive levels of experience, and that is what Ven. Ñāṇavīra meant by
saying that they are perpendicular (see footnote 2). As a result of the
presence of ignorance, this ‘owner’ which we mentioned above also
appears like something which is <em>somewhere within</em> our
experience, ‘neither here nor there’. This elusiveness is maintained by
the lack of one’s capability of an indirect approach,<a href="#fn45"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a>
and as a result this ‘owner’ becomes identified with reflexive or
immediate or reflexive-and-immediate or non-reflexive-nor-immediate
aspects of life. In structural terms, simply not seeing this ‘towards’
of the hierarchy of awareness, makes the experience distorted, and
following it means that one is going ‘with the grain’—<em>anuloma</em>.
Only, when ‘towards’ is <em>indirectly</em> seen as being
<em>directly</em> dependent upon things which are impermanent, then the
hierarchy of awareness will lose its ‘pressure’ and remain standing
there, “cut off at the root, like a palm stump.” (MN 72 / i, 487) At
this point the actual hierarchy is <em>paṭiloma</em>, ‘against the
grain’, i.e. ‘towards’ is seen as impermanent and because of that it
ceases to be the <em>reason of one’s actions</em>, i.e. Self is
destroyed.</p>
<p>Thus, Self is the reason for the existence of Self, i.e. both
reflexion and immediacy are equally affected by it. Only when
reflexion-and-immediacy are seen as a whole as being determined by
something else, the nature of the Self becomes revealed, which is that
it is <em>not-Self</em> (neither owner nor master). Thus, that
<em>thing</em> which was regarded as Self, does not disappear upon
realization of <em>anicca</em> and <em>dukkha</em>, it ‘changes
direction’, so to speak, and becomes not-Self, <em>anattā</em>. However,
even then, the thing remains there and what disappears is Self-view,<a
href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> and that is because the hierarchy
of awareness has lost its ‘pressure’;<a href="#fn47"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>
thus certain assumptions in regard to reflexive hierarchy disappear.</p>
<h3 id="papañca-saññā-sankhā">Papañca-Saññā-Sankhā</h3>
<p>This compound has represented, to paraphrase John D. Ireland from his
Udāna translation notes, a stumbling block which even the ancient
commentaries find difficult to define. If the importance of the term is
to be deduced from the extent of its difficulty then indeed
understanding of this compound carries a lot of significance in regard
to grasping of the Buddha’s Teaching.</p>
<p>There are various translations of <em>papañca-saññā-sankhā</em>, with
currently the most prominent ones being either Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi’s
“notions [born of] mental proliferations” translating the term
<em>papañca</em> as ‘proliferation’; or Ven. Ñāṇamoli Thera’s
“calculations of perceptions of diversifications” where he renders
papañca as ‘diversification’. Beyond these two, plus the PTS Dictionary
definition, I am not familiar in detail with any other different
interpretations of this compound. I am aware that Ven. Ñāṇananda in his
“Concept and Reality in Early Buddhist Thought” addresses this topic to
a certain degree and also that Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi based his views of the
term upon this interpretation<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> but I, myself, have
never actually read Ven. Ñāṇananda’s book so my view on this matter will
come from perhaps, to some extent, a different angle.</p>
<p>To start with, the respective terms ‘diversification’ and
‘proliferation’ do not deviate from the meaning of <em>papañca</em>.
According to the PTS dictionary, <em>papañca</em> is “expansion,
diffuseness, manifoldedness” or “obstacle, hindrance or delay”. The
other members of the compound are defined as <em>saññā</em> (perception)
and <em>sankhā</em> (sign or characteristic). So the above-mentioned
translations would, to some degree, convey the nature of
<em>papañca-saññā-sankhā</em> quite accurately and, as Ven. Bhikkhu
Bodhi says in <em>The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha</em><a
href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> (endnote no. 229, p. 1204-5), “no
rendering [of this compound] is utterly beyond doubt”. The question
which raises itself then is not how to etymologically trace the exact
roots and origination of the compound, since such, a task in this case
proves impossible in the absolute sense (and many seem to agree with
this). Rather, it is better to focus and try to find out <em>within</em>
one’s own experience and practice what is implied existentially and
phenomenologically in the Suttas by this term.</p>
<p>At the risk of being incomprehensible on some points, I would try to
use ‘descriptive’ language, rather than overly technical terms as
people’s general views are already quite firm in regard to such
terminology and it is very likely that they will be coming from a quite
different place than me, probably <em>too</em> different which could
obstruct them from understanding what I’m trying to say. In order to
reduce this possibility to a minimum I thought of using some more common
terms in my descriptions which carry less chance of being misunderstood.
I hope I won’t miss the mark too much.</p>
<p>Those familiar with phenomenology and the philosophy of existence
should not have any problems in understanding a statement like all our
experience is intentional or teleological or simply—significant. Each
thing (<em>dhamma</em>) which is being experienced in our everyday life
has, as its <em>inherent nature</em>, to point to other thing(s), within
the experience as a whole. The thing’s significance is not something
‘steady’ or ‘inchangeable’, although it often might appear so. The
significance of a thing is, rather, something which is being
<em>acquired</em> through the <em>repetition</em> of the respective
experiences of that very thing. During this, the whole perception of a
thing comes to ‘grow’ in a course of time, so to speak, and though there
are certainly significances which are <em>recognized</em> as common to
all people, at a more fundamental level they are all
<em>individually</em> acquired and carried by each of us<a href="#fn50"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Without going into greater details let us say that in the Suttas this
intentionality of experience is what is meant by the statement “with the
grain” or <em>anuloma</em>. Actually, it is probably better to be more
precise and to re-qualify this and say: taking for granted this
intentionality, holding it and appropriating it, makes this
<em>with</em> of “with the grain” to appear. In the <em>arahant</em>’s
case, the ignorance is completely destroyed, yet the grain still
remains, i.e. things <em>do not</em> stop pointing to other things, but
this ‘with’ ceases to exist and is being replaced by ‘against’ as a
result of which we get “against the grain”—<em>patiloma</em>. What has
changed is the fundamental <em>direction</em> of regarding this very
<em>directionality of experience.</em> Thus, even in the case of
complete liberation things continue to be teleological or ‘with purpose’
so they still point to other things and so on. All this is being
mentioned for the reason that the term <em>papañca</em> is probably too
often misunderstood to simply mean ‘mental proliferation’, ‘when one
thinks or analyzes too much’ or something like that. Although these
things do imply <em>papañca</em> (or to be more precise ignorance and
desire-and-lust), the above said nevertheless shows us that if
<em>papañca</em> is anything, it is certainly more fundamental than
that. In support of this we may add that <em>papañca</em> is frequently
linked with <em>maññanā</em>, ‘conceving’ (for which see Mūlapariyāya
Sutta, MN 1) which certainly represents the most fundamental
‘occurrence’ in a mind affected with ignorance. Thus, what
<em>papañca</em> would imply is nothing less than this very
<em>intentionality</em> of our experience and its <em>tendency</em> to
grow and expand. However this can happen only when that ‘with’ is
present i.e. when the mind is not free from the bonds of ignorance and
when it keeps following things in their appearance— “…his consciousness
flows after the sign of form [sound, smell, tastes, touches, thoughts],
is tied and shackled by gratification in the sign of form, if fettered
by the fetter of gratification…”<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>. And surely enough it
is said that the <em>arahant</em> is <em>nippapañca</em>—without
diversifications, free from any attachments (<em>upadhi</em>), free from
burden <em>accumulated</em> in the past.</p>
<p>Thus, one’s world (everything which appears—<em>nāma-rūpa</em>),
expands. One’s views, desires etc. expand too, yet this should not be
understood in a momentary sense, which would suggest that they will
somehow ‘shrink’ afterwards<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> by themselves. Their
<em>intensity</em> or the <em>intensity of their presence</em>, once
‘accumulated’ i.e. came to being, is being ‘assumed’ or ‘held’
(<em>upādāna</em>) at that (new) face value. When this happens—and it
happens through the repetition of [ignorant] actions as said
above—consciousness “becomes established” upon that <em>degree of
presence</em>, which then becomes the <em>actual experience</em> of that
<em>thing</em>. Thus, the intensity of experience, that which appears as
<em>nāma-rūpa</em> grows (for more details see Mahānidāna Sutta, DN 15
[ii,63]). This kind of pattern stretches from the most fundamental
levels of our existence (as seen in Mūlapariyāya Sutta), up to the
coarsest ones which we might say are, “resorting to rods and weapons, of
quarrels, brawls, disputes, recrimination, malicious words and false
speech<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>…”, that is <em>the directly painful
actions resulting from one’s ignorance</em>. Thus, based on the above,
<em>papañca</em> represents the ‘diffusion’ of this fundamental
underlying principle with ignorance being <em>necessarily present</em>,
and consequently <em>papañca-saññā-sankhā</em> are all ‘calculations’ or
‘notions’, perceived and originated as a result of taking this principle
of diffusion for granted i.e. not understanding it.</p>
<p>To conclude, it is worth mentioning that this whole situation would
be much clearer if we can bear in mind Ven. Ñāṇavīra Thera’s description
of the infinite hierarchy of consciousness, the different levels of
generality of <em>nāma-rūpa</em>—<em>viññāṇa</em>. That is because
<em>papañca-saññā-sankhā</em> is not something which appears on a
voluntary level, as if one could stop it at any time; it stretches from
the most general (reflexive) levels of existence<a href="#fn54"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>.
What one is responsible for, in that whole structure, is “delighting in,
welcoming and holding to…” the “source through which perceptions and
notions [born of] mental proliferation beset a man…”<a href="#fn55"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>.
Thus the hierarchy of signifying things continues to arise (cease and
change-while-standing) but it no longer grows; it is “cut off at the
root, made like a palm stump”. Its root was ignorance in itself and with
its absence everything founded upon it comes to an end—one is free. In
other words the respective experiences of the <em>puthujjana</em> and
<em>arahant</em> alike, share the same fundamental nature of
impermanence (arising and ceasing) but the respective
<em>intensities</em> of those experiences are changed; for the
<em>arahant feeling none</em> of it)<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> and for the
<em>puthujjana</em> dependant on the amount of ignorance being present.
More ignorance, more ‘intensity’, things appear as more ‘pressing’ and
one is easily prone to giving in to desire-and-lust. The arising of
things in the <em>puthujjana</em>’s mind brings diffusion of perceptions
and notions which, while not understood at its roots, will in return
diffuse further and further and so on. This cannot happen in the
<em>arahant</em>’s mind any more. His consciousness has ‘ceased’ so
there is nothing to follow and diversify upon this teleological
characteristic of the existential structure, which will remain only
until his aggregates ‘break apart’.</p>

<p><em>Pabhassaram</em>—this could be translated as ‘bright’, and it
should be regarded as something lit up, shining, effulgent or
<em>lucid</em>. To find out how this term should be understood, one can
bring to mind the term <em>ākāsa</em>—space—which literally means
‘shining forth’, in the sense of a space which is lit up. In MN 49, we
can see that consciousness is referred to as <em>viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ
anantaṃ sabbato pabhaṃ,</em> where ‘non-indicative’, ‘infinite’ (or
endless, limitless) and ‘completely radiant’ (i.e. utterly and
fundamentally lucid, not to be understood in a sense of mystically
beaming rays of light or similar), are the terms referring to
<em>viññāṇa</em>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> The whole point is that
‘brightness’ is an epithet describing the inherently <em>infinite
structure</em> of the mind, which is ‘defiled’ by the obstructions
(i.e. made <em>finite</em>). In SN 35.202 the Buddha said:</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>How, friends, does one not leak? Here, friends, having seen form with
eye, a monk does not incline towards pleasing forms, he is not affected
by displeasing forms. He lives aware of the body there and with mind
that is boundless.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>A monk can dwell and live his life with a “boundless mind”.<a
href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> <a href="#fn59"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a>
He has understood the nature of the body <em>there</em> together with
the arisen structure of the present experience,<a href="#fn60"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a>
which is infinite. By understanding the infinite or boundless, any
boundaries and finiteness that were present as a result of that lack of
understanding, are removed. In other words, the ‘brightness’ or
‘lucidity’ or ‘infinity’ or ‘boundlessness’ are the ways of describing
the <em>property</em> of the fundamental structure of experience, which
is the very reason why overcoming the obstructions is possible.</p>
<p><em>Āgantuka</em>—here it is translated as ‘superimposed’. It can
also mean adventitious, incidental, accessory. The main point that has
to be borne in mind is that the ‘obstructions’ are “incidental”, in the
sense that they are not caused by the <em>pabhassaramidaṃ cittaṃ,</em>
but are nevertheless there. The defiling obstructions do not have
anything in common with the brightness of the mind; they are simply
“layered” there, superimposed without actually affecting the infinite
structure. Thus, since the infinite mind does not need those
obstructions, it can be rightly said that they are completely
gratuitous.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>So, obstructions, or more precisely <em>avijjā</em>, have no
<em>first point</em> when they are manifested before which mind was
pure, bright and unpolluted. Because of this it is not correct to refer
to ‘bright mind’ as an <em>original thing</em>, as if it existed in a
pure state <em>before</em> the obstructions arrived. Since there is no
beginning to the infinity, nor to the beginningless <em>avijjā</em>, the
notions of “first this, then that” have no place to apply. So how shall
this evident priority of the ‘bright mind’ be understood then? The
answer is straight—in an atemporal, structural sense. The infinity of
the mind precedes <em>avijjā</em> ontologically, so to speak, while they
are there both, <em>simultaneously present.</em> This should also shed
some light onto why the structure of the mind does not imply nor require
the obstructions (hence they are called ‘obstructions’)—they are
superfluous, unnecessary, superimposed. Yet, the <em>uppakilesā</em> are
there, and are not to be found elsewhere.<a href="#fn62"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>
To put this all in different words: the infinity of one’s mind is a
temporally more fundamental than one’s own nescience in regard to it.
Furthermore, it is because of the nescience in regard to the <em>nature
of infinity</em>, that <em>avijjā</em> is <em>a beginningless</em>
<em>phenomenon</em>. If infinity has no beginning, how could the
fundamental ignorance of that be different?</p>
<p>This is not all, there are further implications of one’s ignorance of
the infinite structure—namely, <em>permanence.</em> The uninstructed
worldling confuses the notion of infinity (no beginning, no end) with
the notion of <em>eternity</em>, or rather <em>identifies</em> the two.
In this way, a present experience is regarded as eternal or permanent.
What a <em>puthujjana</em> does not see is that eternity implies
infinity, but the infinity does not imply eternity.<a href="#fn63"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a>
Because of the nescience in regard to this, the <em>puthujjana’s</em>
experience of infinity <em>assumes</em> permanence. In other words, his
<em>citta</em> is regarded as permanent; he regards his Self as
permanent. If one would be able to see the infinity without eternity, or
even to see it as impermanent, the notion of Self, and everything else
that depended upon it, (which required the notion of permanence), would
cease without a remainder. Knowing infinity as something present
(i.e. arisen) but impermanent (for the very reason that it has
<em>arisen</em> on its own accord), clears the mind of any obstructions,
any superimposed interferences with the infinite structure. Hence it is
said that the <em>arahant’s</em> mind is <em>immeasurable.</em><a
href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> His <em>citta</em> has been
developed to the structurally more fundamental state, and it is because
this state was always <em>possible</em> (but not <em>actual</em>)<a
href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> that transcending the obstructions
was feasible. In other words, if one’s mind was <em>inherently</em>
ignorant—i.e. <em>avijjā</em> structurally preceded any
experience—arahantship would not be possible. (See footnote <a

<p>The Teaching is for the one who feels. When one thinks “this is what

one’s perception, what one feels is one’s feeling.<a href="#fn67"

Feeling and perception are simply <em>there</em>, superimposed,
independent and different in nature.</p>
<p><strong>“What one feels, that one perceives.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thinking that it is <em>the same</em> thing that one feels
and <em>simultaneously</em> perceives, means one <em>assumes</em> that

That thing <em>is.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Thinking that it is <em>a different</em> thing that one feels

<p><strong>Thinking that it is <em>both-the-same-and-different</em>
thing that one feels and <em>simultaneously</em> perceives, means one

<em>independent</em> of that feeling and perception. That thing
<em>is.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Thinking that it is <em>neither-the-same-nor-different</em>
thing that one feels and <em>simultaneously</em> perceives, means one

<em>is.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Thus, through that assumption, one <em>identifies</em> that
thing<em>.</em></strong></p>
<p>Whether one thinks it is the same, or different, or both or neither,
feeling is there<em>, regardless</em> of the perception in regard to it.
Thus, a feeling cannot be thought, it can only be <em>felt.</em> A
perception cannot be felt, it can only be <em>perceived.</em> One has to
learn <em>how to feel</em>, or how to <em>know</em> ‘that because of
which’ the feeling is.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"

it from that which perception is. This cannot be done by separating
feeling and perception and examining them individually.<a href="#fn69"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a>
So how can one do it then?-</p>
<p><strong>By <em>feeling</em> [the feeling]<em>.</em> By

<p><strong>By <em>cognizing

<p><strong>By <em>understanding</em> cognizing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>By <em>not-conceiving</em> perception.</strong></p>
<p>If the superimposition of these two completely independent
simultaneously present domains is understood, the assumption of <em>an
independent thing</em>,<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a> outside of feeling and perception
ceases to be “a bridge” for the two. The ‘thing’ which is being
<em>identified</em> (as the same, different,
both-the-same-and-different, neither-the-same-nor-different)<em>,</em>
is that “bridge” and feeling and perception ‘meet’ or ‘come together’
because of it. That thing is assumed <em>to be that</em> which one
<em>feels</em> and <em>perceives</em>.<a href="#fn71"

In this way, feeling and perception (and consciousness) also come to be

feeling and perception makes them <em>manifest in</em> that

(sounds, smells…thoughts) <em>that is felt</em>. Because of that feeling
one sets upon to ‘affect’ those sights (sounds, smells, …thoughts), sets
upon to change them, modify them, adjust them, pursue them, avoid them;
one gets <em>entangled</em> in the sights (sounds, smells…thoughts)
<em>on account</em> <em>of what</em> one feels <em>when they are</em> .
Knowing that feeling is <em>just there-</em>being felt, and perception

is made redundant, disowned, dropped down, never to picked up again.
Why? Because it was structurally impossible to get entangled in the

condition for ‘matter’; Either way-the assumption is <em>there.</em></p>
<p>That which is designated he resists as the same, different,

because of which ‘matter’ is there. The resistance <em>manifests</em> in
this ‘name’.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"

<p>What a <em>puthujjana</em> has to realise is that regardless of
<em>what</em> he perceives, it is always his <em>perception</em> that is
perceived. Whether it is ‘earth’, ‘water’, ‘fire’, ‘air’ or any other
thing that MN 1 mentions, all one will ever perceive
(<em>puthujjana</em> and <em>arahant</em> alike) is one’s own perception
of that ‘matter’.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"

‘matter’ is and will <em>always be outside</em> of one’s reach, outside
of that which has appeared.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a> Perception is that
which is perceived, but perception would not be possible if there is no
matter to be perceived; on the other hand matter would be
<em>inconceivable</em> if perception was indiscernible. If one thinks
“it is because of the matter, that perception is there”, <em>that</em>
thought is <em>perceived</em>, which means that <em>that</em> which is
‘matter’ <em>in that thought</em> is also perceived. But since it is
only perception that can be perceived, that ‘matter’ which is perceived
in that thought, cannot be that ‘matter’ which cannot be perceived,
since it is perceived. In this way, <em>from</em> ‘matter’, a
<em>puthujjana</em> has a percept of ‘matter’, which he
<em>conceives</em> to be that <em>same</em> ‘matter’ because of which
there is a percept of matter. Or he conceives it to be
<em>different</em> ‘matter’ because of which there is a percept of
matter. Or he conceives it to be <em>both-same &amp;-different</em>
‘matter’ because of which there is a percept of matter. Or he conceives
it to be <em>neither-same-nor-different</em> ‘matter’ because of which
there is a percept of matter. Either way ‘matter’ is <em>conceived.</em>
He becomes responsible for the <em>manifestation</em> of the conceiving
of that ‘matter’, he “makes” that ‘matter’ <em>exist</em>.<a

But, since that ‘my matter’ is conceived as that ‘matter’ <em>because of

becomes ‘<em>my perception</em>’.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a> The same goes for
one’s feelings and intentions. They are all conceived as <em>mine</em>.

thinks he <em>himself</em> <em>is</em> – the view of Self exists. <a

<p>4. When consciousness does not indicate any ‘me’ or ‘mine’, that
‘matter’ because of which there is a percept of matter, does not
manifest itself in that perception (or feeling, or intention)-it does
not manifest itself in ‘name’. Thus, in perception there is only
perception, i.e. in the seen there is only that which is seen,
namely-the seen (and so on for all the senses).<a href="#fn92"

<p>– Ānāpānasati Sutta (MN 118)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1. The practice of ānāpānasati or mindfulness of breathing represents
a phenomenological exercise in developing the principle of simultaneity
(akālikā dhamma). This is accomplished by the sufficient establishing of
mindfulness and knowledge of what one is supposed to do and discern.<a
href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a> It is an exercise because it
requires one actively engaging in and being aware of the act of
breathing, and it develops the principle of simultaneity because while
one is actively breathing, one is aware of one’s actions (body,
feelings, and thoughts). These are two different, simultaneously present
things: the physical or bodily act of breathing, and the mental
reflexive thoughts of one doing that very act. One is not supposed to be
favoured on account of the other; a person should not be overdoing the
breathing (i.e. turning it into a forceful breathing exercise) nor
should he be underdoing it (i.e. forgetting about the act of breathing
that is being performed, and letting it happen unawares). In the same
sense one should not overthink one’s thinking (i.e. get lost in
thought). The point is to mindfully breathe while remaining fully aware
of oneself-mindfully-breathing, or – to put it simply – to remain aware
of the present phenomenon of “I am breathing.”</p>
<p>2. Breathing is an intentional action, not a habit, and there is
volition involved in every single breath a person takes. The reason why
most people think breathing is an automated process is because they are
almost never aware of it. Thus the intentional side of the breath
remains obscured.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a> By being an act (kamma), it has
potential, if understood as such, to reveal the nature of all acts
(present, future and past), of everything one has ever intentionally
done and planning to do. By being an intentional act, breathing shares
the same universal nature as all good and evil actions in this world.
The reason why breathing is such a suitable act for the practice of
mindfulness<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>112</sup></a> is because it is an immediately
neutral action, there is no actual good or bad involved in it. Thus,
although it shares the same nature as all these other more “kammically”
(and consequentially) engaging acts, there are no future results
involved that would pertain to oneself and others. The merit of an
in-breath ceases with an out-breath.</p>
<p>3. As we see from the opening excerpt, by “training oneself thus…,” a
monk develops mindfulness of both immediate and possible action (kamma):
“I breathe in/out (thus)…,” and “(thus) I shall breathe in/out….” This
kind of mindfulness when developed leaves nothing out, and one is
simply, yet steadily, becoming more aware of the nature of action in
general while that very action is actually present. Ultimately of
course, this leads to the full transparency of that “I”, in that
experience of breathing as a whole, and it’s utterly redundant nature
that is being gratuitously assumed.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref113" role="doc-noteref"><sup>113</sup></a> This nature, if
mindfulness pursued to the extent necessary,<a href="#fn114"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114" role="doc-noteref"><sup>114</sup></a>
can eventually be completely understood and the gratuitous “I”
destroyed. This, however, should not be taken in a sense that the
phenomenon of “I” would disappear like it was never there, but in a
sense that that “I” will cease to be “me” and “mine”. It will remain
just standing there, hollow and dry.</p>
<p>4. The reason why it is recommended that one should sit when
exercising mindfulness of breathing is because such a posture offers the
least distractions to one’s mind. When seated, one will not be engaging
in any other action different from breathing (and passively sitting of
course). So, the only thing that one is going to be doing is breathing.
In this way it can be understood that sitting is the most optimal
posture to have, so that one wouldn’t be wasting any effort.
Consequently, with the further development of the discernment of the
simultaneously present phenomena, and with the strengthening of
mindfulness, one can more freely assume other postures and not remain
confined to sitting alone. Furthermore, even engaging in other acts, for
example: “while breathing, I am sweeping the floor,” will not be a
distraction for one’s mindfulness in any way. In this particular
instance, one’s mindfulness and discernment is divided, or shared by,
two simultaneously present actions (sweeping and breathing), while one
is also simultaneously aware of that thing as a whole. And this division
can continue as far as the strength of one’s mindfulness allows, though
there is no particular benefit and reason in pushing it.</p>
<p>5. Sometimes people assume that in ānāpānasati one is mindful of the
“body of breath,” as opposed to just one’s (experience of) body.<a
href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>115</sup></a> This rendering comes from the
confusion and lack of phenomenological insight into the nature of the
(appearing) body. If one is to understand that whether it is the
ordinary experience of one’s body in everyday existence, or an unusual
one resulting from the new practice of concentration, or even a strange
sense of lightness of one’s body on drugs, in phenomenological terms –
body is just there. Thus, again, regardless of the particular way one’s
body presents itself, it is the phenomenon of the body that is present,
and that’s what one should be concerned with. So, when practising
mindfulness of breathing, one actually devotes direct attention to the
‘act of breathing,’ that body (or that strange-sense-of-body) that
emerges as a phenomenon, peripherally, is that which is the body, in
that experience right then and there. In this way one experiences one’s
body through an act of breathing, which is why the Buddha said that
body, as one of the foundations of mindfulness, is brought to
fulfillment in the practice of ānāpānasati.<a href="#fn116"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>By being able to see peripherally that which appears as peripheral,
but simultaneously present, one does not conceive it. It is the
intention in regard to the peripheral,<a href="#fn117"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a>
which tends to make things actual<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref118" role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a> that carries
appropriation. If one succeeds in leaving it peripheral (i.e. the way it
has arisen), one is practicing mindfulness correctly. The tendency
towards ‘conceivings’ will slowly fade when the mindfulness reaches the
necessary extent. Again, knowledge of what the conceiving is (i.e. not
understanding the phenomenon of simultaneously and dependently present
and leaving it as such), is an absolute requirement, because without it
this whole practice won’t bear fruits of any fundamental importance.
However, even a puthujjana, by trying to understand what the correct
practice of mindfulness is, might actually understand it, and then cease
to be a puthujjana, so this whole practice should be encouraged
regardless.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<p>6. The contemporary Buddhist outlook usually equates the practice of
ānāpānasati with the practice of jhānas, and if not regarded as the
same, it is too often thought that by practicing ānāpānasati one will by
default “enter” a jhāna. I suspect this assumption stems from the
commentarial times, whereby various meditation techniques, that revolve
around the idea of the mindfulness of breathing, were concocted and
advertised as something that would directly lead to the experience of
jhānas.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<p>Jhānas are the establishments of mind, and as such they are to be
developed upon the sufficient degree of mindfulness, which in return can
be established upon various different things, ānāpānasati being one of
them.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>121</sup></a> Thus, it should be clear, that the
practice of jhāna is a fundamentally different practice from
ānāpānasati. While ānāpānasati shares a nature of the phenomenological
exercise of one’s actions in regard to body, feelings, mind and
thoughts, jhāna is less of that, but more of an establishment of one’s
mind upon a certain way of attending to things (in this case upon a
phenomenological surmounting of the sensual domain), and the discernment
involved therein. In other words, by understanding what jhāna is, one
enters it,<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>122</sup></a> not by performing a set of
prescribed motions that somehow make it “happen” to one.</p>
<p>Obviously, one can develop and establish an unwavering mindfulness
through the practice of ānāpānasati, and once established one could
change one’s outlook and with such mindfulness recognize the extent of
sensuality, as a phenomenon, and what exactly it entails, and by doing
so step outside of it, so to speak. In this way one would enter the
first jhāna, where that mindfulness would remain fully established and
can be developed even further.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref123" role="doc-noteref"><sup>123</sup></a> It is clear here
that it is not that ānāpānasati in itself took one automatically into a
jhāna, but that the change of attending to things did,<a href="#fn124"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124" role="doc-noteref"><sup>124</sup></a>
once the mindfulness was strong enough. Furthermore, jhāna is not taught
as a goal in itself, as Kāyagatāsati Sutta (MN 119) tells us, but as one
of the forms that can bring one’s mindfulness to the necessary
fulfillment.</p>
<p>So, in order for any of these paragraphs to be intelligible, one will
have to abandon the notions of “meditation techniques” and all the
contemporary ideas of the practice of concentration, which is usually
taught at the expense of mindfulness and with underlying wrong views
(such as mystical absorptions and novelty experiences that then become a
measure of one’s “success”). When a person hears the term ānāpānasati,
he will be better o thinking “development of mindfulness” – the same
mindfulness that he has to varying extents in his day-to-day
experiences.</p>
<p>7. “Meditation techniques” are usually sets of fairly random motions
and performances, idiosyncratic to the particular meditation teacher,
that require one to fol ow certain prescribed steps which if performed
correctly, and with some luck, will make one experience “something”.
Often, in return, that same teacher would have to “interpret” back these
experiences for one.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly: if one needs to be told by another what the
significance of one’s experience was, this means one has not understood
it by oneself. It means one is still concerned with the particular
aspects (i.e. the random contents) of one’s meditation experience, and
one fails to see the general nature of it all. As a result, any external
interpretation is regarded as an explanation, which means that
phenomenology remains buried deep down under layers of preconceived
ideas and assumptions. This holds true even more when it comes to the
idea of “attainments”, which are also regarded as experiences that
“happen” to one, almost against one’s will and as a result of “a very
good technique” one has employed. There is a concealed irony there that
escapes such people, because if one needs to be “confirmed” a sotāpanna,
for example, by one’s teacher, this means one doesn’t know that one
actually is a sotāpanna, which means that one can still doubt it, which
in return means that one is not freed from the fetter of doubt, i.e.
actually not a sotāpanna. The irony is further amplified if the teacher
goes ahead and “confirms” one. If one is to actually understand what
“being free from doubt” (and the other two fetters, characteristic of
the sotāpanna) is, one would realize how non-applicable any external
affirmation or denial is.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref125" role="doc-noteref"><sup>125</sup></a></p>
<p>How obstructive to phenomenology (i.e. mindfulness) this whole way of
practising is, can be seen from the nature of understanding. One
understands things when one understands them, when the knowledge in
regard to the nature of an arisen thing is there, and not when one
successfully goes through a set of methods and observances that relies
on an almost mechanical set of motions one has to perform attentively.
Any bodily act and any act that pertains to the bodily domain (such as
the celebrated and misguided notion of “sensations”<a href="#fn126"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126" role="doc-noteref"><sup>126</sup></a>
which involve observing different parts and aspects of one’s body) is
simply irrelevant for the discerning of the nature of an arisen
phenomenon.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>127</sup></a> It is misleading and obstructive,
because it is impossible to engage in a technique without the implicit
belief that a set of motions, that the chosen technique consists of,
performed in a particular mechanical order, will somehow, by itself,
reveal the nature of things. By holding this belief and faith in a
technique, one will not be trying to understand things, and by not
making attempts toward the understanding, one will definitely remain
devoid of it.</p>
<p>One sees things correctly – as phenomena – by understanding what the
phenomenon is, and there is no technique that can make this magically
occur. Thus, the closest to what one should do in order to obtain
understanding is: trying to understand. For as long as a person is
attempting to understand and see the nature of an arisen thing, that
person might actually succeed in it, for it is certain that
understanding cannot occur in someone who is not trying to understand.
Incidentally (or not), there is never any mention of meditation
techniques in the Suttas, but ‘understanding’ and ‘discernment’, as a
way to reach the final freedom from suffering, is described and referred
to countless times.</p>
<p>When one looks at the experience mindfully, it becomes apparent that
regardless of the content of the particular experience, the nature of
experience is present. So, whether it is the experience of
“impatiently-waiting-for-a-bus,” or the experience of tiredness after a
physical exertion, or strange and novel experience of a powerful light
that occurred in front of me while meditating on a seven-day
technique-based meditation retreat, all I should be concerned about is
that an experience is there and as such it needs to be understood.<a
href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>128</sup></a> This means that investing effort
into meditation techniques is fundamentally a waste of time if one is
concerned with understanding the Dhamma, and the most one can accomplish
is relaxation, a sense of peace coming from withdrawal from the habitual
world of senses, or – worse – fortification of the wrong views based on
a misinterpretation of the nature of the novelty experiences. Either
way, the results of any technique one might engage in, will remain
worldly, and will draw its power from a temporary change of one’s
environment, one’s usual way of regarding things. In any case, the
“benefits” and “helpfulness” of a chosen technique will simply share the
nature of a phenomenon of novelty that one is experiencing. As such, it
means it will run out, and one will have to either do it harder, or
change the technique.</p>
<p>If people attend meditation retreats as a form of a temporary escape
from the busy and oppressing world, by all means they should do it, as
often as they can. However, rather than engaging in a practice of a
technique and “sensation watching,” they would be better o using their
quiet time in trying to understand the nature of things according to the
way the Buddha described it, whether sitting, walking or lying down. For
it is that “nature” which the Dhamma means and refers to, and anything
that is not dealing with this, or anything that is obscuring that very
nature (i.e. phenomena) of things, consequently is not the Dhamma, no
matter how “helpful” and “useful” it might be.<a href="#fn129"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129" role="doc-noteref"><sup>129</sup></a>
In different words, one’s experience is phenomenological (i.e. the five
aggregates are all simultaneously present in their respective domains),
and this means that nature of things comes first,<a href="#fn130"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130" role="doc-noteref"><sup>130</sup></a>
before anything one does based on that nature. Doing a technique in
order to practice the Dhamma (i.e. see the nature of things) is like
exiting the house, so as to be in it. It’s a contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>8. In the first establishment of mind, the first jhāna, the
appropriation of the bodily action (intention) ceases. This is
accomplished when that thought, which in ordinary experience stands for
that which is the body (and anything originating from it) is seen in its
phenomenological nature, i.e. as thought,<a href="#fn131"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131" role="doc-noteref"><sup>131</sup></a>
When the mind is thus established upon the signs and characteristics of
one’s thought, as an arisen thing, that thought is recognized as being
indifferent<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>132</sup></a> to anything other than itself,
such as body and matter.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref133" role="doc-noteref"><sup>133</sup></a> Through that very
indifference, the thought, even if it thinks about the body and anything
bodily, ceases to stand for ‘that’ which is the body (rūpa). This is why
the first jhāna is primarily characterized by thinking-and-pondering
(vittakavicāra) and it is also why the sensual domain (i.e. domain that
is pertaining to the body) has been surmounted. The result of this
cessation is the subsiding of speech – the physical, bodily aspect of
it. By dropping the appropriation of the bodily intention, through the
surmounting of its whole domain, one clearly sees the whole body as an
independent thing, just sitting there, already given. Even if one is to
make a bodily intention, one would see that intention too, as something
that is inevitably and inseparably confined to the bodily domain and as
such: as something that can never be “mine”. This is why the first
establishment of mind is also sufficient for the final knowledge.<a
href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
<p>Furthermore, it is because of this very principle of thought ceasing
to ‘stand for’ that which is the body, that the jhānas are wholesome in
themselves, even if not accompanied by understanding. By “ceasing to
stand for” the wrong order of the experience is reversed, and the
structurally independent, simultaneously present and indifferent to each
other individual domains of the aggregates are experienced as they are,
without the distortion introduced by assumption in regard to them. This
is why the Buddha praised the practice of jhāna, because if the person
develops them correctly, even as a puthujjana, he would require very
little instruction in order to understand things and remove all
conceivings and avijjā.</p>
<h3 id="breathing-towards-death">Breathing Towards Death</h3>
<p>Practising the mindfulness of breathing correctly, means practising
the mindfulness of death correctly.</p>
<p>The Buddha has offered mindfulness of breathing as a replacement for
the practice of mindfulness of death. That was because mindfulness of
death pushed some monks over the edge, so to speak. It made them wish
for ending of their life before being fully awakened. Yet, it is
important to note that mindfulness of breath aims at the <em>same</em>
result as mindfulness of death does. That result is dispassion towards
the world and life (of sensuality) in general. The mindfulness of
breathing was a direct response to the need for rapid dispassion of
those committed to its practice. This of course doesn’t mean that
mindfulness of death was wrong, but it means that mindfulness of breath
is simply less risky. It cannot be stressed enough though – they both
aim at the same result.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this applies for any other “meditation” that we find in
Suttas. They might sound very different, but their aim is the same: the
establishment of mindfulness. Mindfulness to the extent necessary for
the discernment of Dhamma. Thus, we can say that if someone’s meditation
is not bringing them closer to <em>understanding</em> of sensuality and
experience of dispassion – that meditation is wrong.</p>
<p>The breath can end at any given moment, and we wouldn’t be able to do
anything about it. Random organ failure, heart attack, lung collapse,
none of these things would be accessible to our will power, yet, our
entire life (that same “will power”) directly and simultaneously depends
on it. For example, if something were to happen to the vital functions
of our body, our life would end that very moment. Regardless of where
our hopes and intentions were aiming at the time. This recognition can
be very unpleasant for an average inauthentic man of the world and it
could result in the experience of a tremendous fear and dread. It is the
aim of the mindfulness of death to cut through the manifold layers of
that inauthenticity. But, as the Buddha has himself seen, it can
sometimes be too much to handle; if a person realizes one’s own
mortality too fast and is not prepared for it. Hence the mindfulness of
breathing comes as a more gradual replacement. A replacement that still,
very much, leads in the same direction of recognizing the inherent
insecurity of one’s own life. This insecurity manifests through
realizing the impermanence of breath, <em>while</em> one mindfully
breathes. So, the difference between mindfulness of breath and
mindfulness of death is not in its “object”, but in a <em>point of
view.</em> (or where the mindfulness is anchored in).</p>
<p>In ‘death meditation’ the point of view is in one’s <em>sense of
Self</em>. This is more “personal” approach (which is why it is sharper,
quicker, and thus <em>riskier</em>). In ‘breath meditation’ the point of
view is placed on the <em>intentional act of breathing</em>. By doing
so, one’s sense of Self is not in the direct center of the experience.
(as opposed to the thought “<em>I</em> <em>will</em> die”, for example).
Either way, one can realize that no matter how volitional an act (of
breathing) might be, it is fundamentally rooted away from one’s control.
(Control that is the exemplification of one’s sense of Self.). This
becomes clear when one recognizes that <em>while</em> breathing, the
body (or the lungs, or heart, etc.) could stop working. They
<em>could</em> fail. That whole dimension, where the failure would come
from, would remain entirely “inaccessible” to one’s intentions and will.
No amount of one’s volition would be able to “cross” that threshold of
control that is determined by the present body that is simply “able to
breath”. (i.e. unobstructed airways, functioning lungs, beating heart,
etc.). In simple terms: one’s sense of control, intentions, will, sense
of Self, are all bound up with presently arisen functioning body. And
the <em>presence</em> of that body is not accessible to one’s will. (If
it were so, we wouldn’t be susceptible to illness, aging and death.).
Recognition of that lack of access to the fundamental aspects of one’s
own life, is the recognition of <em>impermanence</em>. Thus, in
mindfulness of breathing, one exposes oneself to the sharp truth of
<em>anicca</em>, but without winding oneself up through the anxious
contemplation of death.</p>
<p>We can go as far as to say that one’s life is <em>completely</em>
rooted outside one’s own sense of control. In other words, one’s ability
to exercise will and control, is something that one has no control over.
For example: if something random, (an accident or, a disease,) were to
simply block the air passages, no amount of intentional breathing would
be able to help us. Yet, our whole life would depend on it.</p>
<p>Correctly discerning this, results in the <em>right</em> dispassion.
And that means having no desire for either life or death.</p>
<p>The reason why this is very important to see is that many people use
a mere pleasure that they derive from meditation as a criterion for
their progress. But, pleasure is secondary, and is not something an
unawakened being should use to judge things against. Pleasure is not the
measure of success, it’s the unshakeable composure of peace in the face
of death, that is. Thus, one’s meditation of breath should establish
itself upon mindfulness of the impermanence as described above. It
should not become something agreeable that one uses for not dealing with
the world.</p>
<p>A dying man can only rely upon his wisdom, if he developed it. Wisdom
is not dependent upon any phenomenon originated upon six senses. It is
developed on the basis of the <em>discernment</em> of the same. That’s
why when one’s senses start to wither and die, the knowledge of their
nature remains unaffected. When there is no wisdom, there will be
despair, in the face of death.</p>
<h3 id="intentions-behind-ones-actions">Intentions Behind One’s
Actions</h3>
<p>The Right meditation is inseparable from the Right view. That means
that even if a person doesn’t have the Right view, their meditation
should be concerned about getting it. To put it simply – it comes down
to developing the self-transparency (or self-honesty) concerning skilful
as skilful (<em>kusala</em>) and unskilful as unskilful
(<em>akusala</em>). The Buddha defined the Right view in those very
terms – knowing “good as good”, and “bad as bad”. The person with the
Right view knows for oneself, beyond any doubt, <em>kusala</em> as
<em>kusala</em> and <em>akusala</em> as <em>akusala</em>. By seeing it –
he recognizes it. He doesn’t need to hold or adopt any other external
criteria. The clarity of his vision pertains to here and now,
internally. Thus, for someone who hasn’t achieved that yet, that’s where
the meditation should start. Obtaining of the Right criteria and then
meditating through it. Keeping it “composed” is the definition of the
Right <em>samadhi</em>.</p>
<p>The problem is that this kind of instruction is very non-specific.
People today usually need something more proliferated and palpable. They
require meditation “methods”. An average man today wants a “recipe”, a
prescription of “steps”. He needs to know what <em>exactly</em> he
should <em>do</em>, that would then automatically result in his
liberation. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work like that. If we look at the
Suttas, whenever the Buddha was talking about meditation it was to bring
the fulfilment of knowledge and wisdom. Yet, if a person has none of the
latter to begin with, then the fulfilment cannot arise nor be fabricated
mechanically. Very often the Buddha’s reply on how to meditate would be
in instructing people in recognizing and avoiding the unskilful, and
cultivating (<em>bhavana</em>) of the skilful. Discerning the nature of
<em>kusala</em> and <em>akusala</em> has the potential of taking the
mind above both. Freeing it from action (<em>kamma</em>) and it’s
results (<em>vipaka</em>), since they are bound to the domain of skilful
and unskilful. And that’s exactly why performing (<em>doing</em> or
<em>acting</em>) of the specific steps, cannot take one beyond the
nature of <em>kamma</em>. Understanding it however, might.</p>
<p>Furthermore, methods and techniques usually don’t amount to more than
management of the problem of suffering. Management of something cannot
actually uproot that very thing. So, instead of that, a person will be
better of in trying to discern what kind of attitude towards meditation
can be sustained throughout the day. An attitude that wouldn’t need any
particular favorable environment or special conditions to be applied in.
Regardless of whether one is sitting in a full lotus posture, or just
walking down the street. One needs to find that kind of
<em>composure</em> that one can maintain in both circumstances. The way
to do this is if the composure is established upon the <em>general
mindfulness</em>. Not the particular observation and adherence to the
prescribed steps of a “meditation” technique, that results in one being
<em>absorbed</em> in it. Absorption is the opposite of general
mindfulness.</p>
<p>Every <em>jhana</em> for example is fully founded upon the basis of
the unshakeable mindfulness as number of Suttas often mention. So, even
if a person wants to do his meditation in a “formal” manner, such as sit
for an hour few times a day, that is fine. As long as it is not done for
the purpose of developing some sort of “experience of absoption” out of
it. Like trying to watch one’s breath hoping for some novelty energy
release. The point of meditation is to remain <em>present</em> as much
as possible. Present or mindful of <em>whatever</em> is <strong>already
there</strong> (feelings, perceptions, intentions). Not interfere with
it, or deny it, or try to replace it. Just discerning the enduring
presence of the arisen experience. Emotionally, perceptually and
intentionally. That kind of composure can then be “spread out” over
one’s entire day, even when a person is not sitting down to
meditate.</p>
<p>And this should not be too hard to grasp (though that doesn’t mean it
will be easy to accept). The whole point of the practice of Dhamma and
meditation is nothing other than understanding of the nature of things.
The understanding that arises on account of mindful discerning of
whatever is <em>arisen</em> and <em>enduring</em> in our experience. And
it’s that understanding of the unskilful that frees the mind from it. If
a person wants to be truly free once and for all, the only way to do so
is through the knowledge and mindfulness.</p>
<p>Thus, if one wants to practice in a manner that pertains to this
final goal of freedom, he needs to become very mindful and honest about
intentionality behind any actions. Simple actions, more complex ones,
careless or important, big or small – actions of any kind done by body,
speech or mind. One will need to attend to them mindfully until the
motivation and intentions behind is fully seen. That is because it is
the intention that defines wholesome action as wholesome and unwholesome
as unwholesome. The “reason” for one’s action so to speak. That’s where
skilfulness of an action is rooted at. That’s also the <em>real</em>
“reason”, the one deep inside that one might not be willing to admit to
oneself. If a person is able to reach the full transparency of one’s
intentional actions and its roots, that person is a step closer in
discerning what makes <em>kusala</em> as <em>kusala</em> and
<em>akusala</em> as <em>akusala</em>. That person is a step closer to
the beginning of the Right criteria or view.</p>
<p>So, if one needs to meditate, one needs to be concerned with one’s
actions and choices. (Which is also why <em>sila</em> or virtue comes
before the Dhamma). In such manner any motivation for one’s intentions
behind doing this or that will reveal and not taken at its face value.
Through this persistent self-questioning one can also see whether an
action that is about to be, is rooted in an unskilful motive. Like
sensuality, ill will, vanity or distraction for example. Furthermore,
one would need to abandon only <em>that</em>. The unwholesome. One
doesn’t need to cancel the entire arisen experience and behaviour. That
would be a form of overdoing it, and not using mindfulness as a criteria
of discernment. “Is what I am about to do rooted in greed? Lust? How
about ill-will and annoyance or anger?” Or “am I acting out of a desire
for distraction and forgetfulness? Am I willingly giving in to acts and
desires that would delude me further and mask the unskilful basis of
those very actions?” Such questioning about the personal and inner
dimension of one’s daily experiences and actions will <em>have to</em>
result in being mindful. This is a definition of (proper) vipassana or
investigation, since that’s exactly what’s being done. Self
investigating the motivation behind any actions. And it is obvious to
see how this kind of attitude and mindful practice would result in
discerning “good as good, bad as bad”. How it would not be dependent on
any external authority or belief. Instead be a direct, visible,
universal criteria seen personally for oneself.</p>
<p>It’s important to note it is not necessary that one becomes neurotic
or obsessed (though it might happen) about it. Always having to
<em>actually</em> ask oneself “what am I doing?” before every action.
What’s important is the <em>attitude</em> of such <em>questioning</em>.
The “answer” is already implied within it. One already <em>knows</em>
why one is acting. Whether one is aware of it or not, that’s a different
matter. Of course, until that attitude is developed and refined, a
person will have to endure possible loss of (superficial) confidence and
choice paralysis. That’s because the implications of one’s smallest
actions are becoming more revealed. A person starts to feel responsible
even for things that are not in his control.</p>
<p>So through this kind of “revealing” of the roots of one’s actions,
one is simultaneously becoming less and less able to ignore one’s true
intentions. One will not be able to turn a blind eye towards acting good
while the real motivation underneath it isn’t necessarily so. That’s why
this attitude is “self-transparent”. Whatever is on the surface, one
simultaneously sees beneath it <em>as well</em>.</p>
<p>Consequently, one will be able to also see if something is genuinely
not rooted in greed, aversion or delusion. In such case even if the
whole world comes to tell him that that’s still “bad”, his discernment
would remain unshaken. As mentioned above, that’s because good and bad
are defined by the intention behind them. Not by the common tradition,
views and opinions, duty and culture, but by whether greed, aversion and
delusion underlies them.</p>
<p>It should be clear by now that the self-honesty or transparency is
not an optional thing (or just one of different ways leading to the same
goal). It’s an absolute pre-requisite for any chance of getting the
Right view and knowing how to practice the Dhamma. If a person still has
difficulties in abandoning own dependence upon a particular “method” of
practice, they can still take up this practice of self-questioning all
the time, as a “method”. Although not ideal, it will still result in
seeing through the motivation and emotional need for any methods in the
first place. (Needing “something to do”.) By seeing the subtle
motivation under <em>any</em> action, one will automatically feel
responsible for one’s choices. No matter how “justified” those might
seem externally. The weight on it is always on oneself, and that’s
something that one cannot ignore any further.</p>
<p>It is also then when the full weight of the Buddha’s “beings are
owners of one’s actions” saying, is truly felt.</p>
<h3 id="the-necessity-of-celibacy">The Necessity of Celibacy</h3>
<p>Practice of celibacy is always beneficial. Even for a lay person, who
is not necessarily Buddhist or familiar with the Dhamma. The obvious
reason for its benefits is the inevitable increase of the mental
strength that comes with the restraint. This restraint is
<em>intentional</em> and aims at a very powerful desire that otherwise
shapes and controls one’s whole life. Sensuality/sexuality is something
that heavily contributes towards defining one’s actions and choices. It
is something that has at least some influence in virtually all of
them.</p>
<p>Thus, adopting a practice of restraint of the sensual desire, a
person will be going against that grain of the natural sexual pull of
one’s own body. Through willingly imposing this restraint, the mind will
be pressured to grow – in terms of strength and in terms of enduring of
itself. (As the case with any strength development is. Gradually
increasing resistance, increases the capacity to hold the very
same.)</p>
<p>Sometimes people think that not having sexual intercourse is all that
being celibate means. That doesn’t constitute the celibacy we are
talking about here. The difference is to not be celibate <em>only</em>
because the current circumstances are presenting no options, but to
actually be celibate as a result of <em>determination</em> and
<em>practice of restraint</em>. (And then one might decide to live in
the circumstance that present no options, and that’s fine.) It’s
important to not misunderstand this. We are not saying that one somehow
needs to be <em>tempting</em> oneself with sensuality. “Flirting” with
it, so to speak, to keep reinforcing the practice of saying “no” to it.
That’s ridiculous. And completely misguided and countering the right
efforts. Flirting with sensuality can only be done out of
<em>sensuality</em>. (As the Buddha said, it’s not possible to have
sensual perception without the mind being bound by sensuality.) So,
tempting oneself with sensuality, it’s already a form of engaging
<em>with</em> sensuality. As such, it goes against the practice of the
celibate determinations.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Firstly, a man who claims to be perfectly celibate does not mutually
engage in sex with a woman. However, they consent to being anointed,
massaged, bathed, and rubbed by a woman. They enjoy it and like it and

celibacy. This is called one who lives the celibate life impurely, tied

in me: ‘My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth; now there are
no more future lives.’”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>– Anguttara Nikaya, 7.50</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, it’s this determination, the decision to not engage with
sensuality ever again that makes all the difference. Just like when a
person is trying to give up smoking for example. It will be much harder
to do so if you bring yourself up to decide to <em>never</em> smoke
again, as opposed to deciding it to quit it half-heartedly for a month
or so. The former would exert much more pressure on an individual and
even someone who was not a heavy, but a casual, smoker would feel the
whole weight of it. And this is even more true of celibacy. And it is
necessary to determine it in such a decisive manner.</p>
<p>Only then the mind will be pushed towards development (provided it
doesn’t break) of strength on that corresponding level. Anything short
of it, the mind will just tread water until the pressure of sexuality
builds up, and then inevitably give in. Determining it decisively,
however, means that person’s entire life will have to be affected by the
profound shift in significance of ordinary things in day to day life.
This is pretty much the main reason why most of the people would be
afraid of doing it.</p>
<p>As hard as it might seem, it is still very much possible to succeed
with a persistent effort over a period of time. If one modifies one’s
environment to support the restraint and to not add more to the already
existing pressure, the mind can eventually become dry of the inherent
“wetness” of the desires. Then everything in person’s life that was
depending on the acts of sensuality and non-restraint, will also “dry
out”. A person would be free from it. This refers to the inherent
worries of protecting what one has acquired, pains of craving towards
what one doesn’t have yet, obstacles of one’s worldly ambitions, and
similar. All these things will have no significance any more. They will
not be able to cause one to suffer on account of them.</p>
<p>It is also important to mention that the <em>sooner</em> one starts
this practice the better. It is not uncommon for people to think that
they have time to get older and pursue sexual and sensual desires. And
that then afterwards, they can practice restraint and free themselves
from desires. Unfortunately, it’s quite the opposite: the longer one
waits the harder it will be to <em>discern</em> sensuality and do
something about it. With old age, sexuality goes “underground” so to
speak. The time comes when the body loses its vigour and the sexuality
won’t manifest any more in a form of obvious physical behaviour and
thirst. This can mislead a person to believe that they are free from it.
What actually happened was that sexuality has now descended from
something that was discernible (bodily actions and thoughts of such) to
something that’s virtually invisible. A subtle <em>background</em> that
becomes a ubiquitous motivation for all sorts of habits, acts and even
psychological needs. They wouldn’t carry the sensual flavour to them
anymore. A flavour that used to be very clear on the surface of them at
all. If the mind hasn’t made the effort, while the aim of the effort was
obvious, it won’t be able to do it now. Of course, it is still possible
in theory at least. But, when the strength and determination fade with
the body, having been left undeveloped for so long, it is very unlikely
that that will change. (The Suttas, though, do list few exceptions of
very old people reaching arahantship. But those were rare, which is why
they were so clearly remembered.)</p>
<p>Thus, the sooner the better. That’s also why many people in time of
the Buddha were inspired to see young monks and nuns in <em>prime</em>
of their life. Meaning: they were at the time of their lives when
sensuality was still available and easy to get. They have not just given
it up, but ended up <em>enjoying</em> the practise of restraint and
understanding the Dhamma.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Then that devata said to the Venerable Samiddhi:”You have gone forth
while young, bhikkhu, a lad with black hair, endowed with the blessing
of youth and strength, in the prime of life, without having dallied with
sensual pleasures. Enjoy human sensual pleasures, bhikkhu; do not
abandon what is directly visible in order to pursue what takes
time.”</p>
<p>“I have not abandoned what is directly visible, friend, in order to
pursue what takes time. I have abandoned what takes time in order to
pursue what is directly visible. For the Blessed One, friend, has stated
that sensual pleasures are time-consuming, full of suffering, full of
despair, and the danger in them is still greater, while this Dhamma is
directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable,
to be personally experienced by the wise.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>— SN 1.20</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We must stress here that practice of sense restraint would be
beneficial even to those who have no interest in practising the Dhamma –
fully or partially. Because if the mind manages to become stronger than
the sensual pull, and learns how to go beyond sensual cravings, it will
to a great degree go beyond the burdens that come with the sensuality.
Burdens that are otherwise unavoidable and bring much worry and
suffering. Going beyond sensuality will also lessen the grip of one’s
own Ego and all the conceit underlying it would be reduced. The
anxieties, lack of satisfaction, guilt over things done in the past –
all of that would disappear or be significantly removed. Of course, we
can only imagine what greater freedom can be gained, if on top of the
steadfast restraint, one also practices the Dhamma instructions towards
uprooting even the subtle conceit and cravings.</p>
<p>The entire life of a person most often revolves around following
desires. Trying to get what one wants is the most fundamental habit of a
human mind. This is quite normal, but the problem is in that
<em>what</em> people want is almost always rooted in sensuality. One’s
desires are most often aimed at the pursuit of the pleasures gained
through physical senses. Pleasant sights, sounds, tastes, smells and
touches. Subtle or coarse. If a man begins to learn how to go against
this <em>sensual</em> “<em>grain</em>” that exhorts pressure on him,
that will already mean a beginning of strength. Of course, mere
resistance to such sensual cravings will not be able to uproot the
sensuality in itself. For that, <em>understanding</em> of the nature of
that sensuality will be necessary. But this is only possible on the
basis of the sense restraint. For example, if a person has been adhering
to the practice of restraint and abstaining from <em>intentionally</em>
giving in to sense desires, that person will be able to see the
gratuitous nature of the sensual desire in a form of one’s own thoughts.
It is something that has arisen completely uninvited, yet pressures one
to act upon it as if it is truly owned by him. Sticking to this kind of
reflection can reveal that even things that one does want and desire,
are rooted and arisen as something that is fundamentally outside of
one’s control. One’s responsibility lies not in preventing those
thoughts from arising, but in choosing to <em>delight</em> and
<em>entertain</em> them. Or not, as the Buddha would tell. In brief:
being able to see the uncontrollable (gratuitous) nature of one’s own
desires, one can overcome the pressure that they exhort on him.</p>
<p>The main reason why most people wouldn’t even consider the practice
of celibacy is because it’s simply too difficult. Because of that it is
also unlikely that a man would choose to do it, outside of some sort of
philosophical belief or a religious practice. There just wouldn’t be
enough motivation.</p>
<p>To reiterate: freedom from sensuality starts by giving it up first.
Saying “no” to it. That is not optional. This initial effort can then
enable a person to allow the nature of desire to <em>manifest</em> and
<em>arise</em>. As opposed to someone who tries to prevent this, or
rather cover it up. This cover up is due to instantaneous giving in to
the pressure of desire (if not physically, at least mentally). Or it is
due to trying to prevent it and deny it. (The former and the latter
correspond to sensual indulgence and self-mortification
respectively.)</p>
<p>Giving in to the pressure, distracts one from seeing what is it that
pressures him in the first place. Denying it, does the same. If one
<em>learns</em> how to endure it through restraint, then it can become
clear that there is no pressure of sensuality <em>without</em> one’s
body. A person at a face value regards one’s own body as basis for
pleasure. It’s seen to be something “free” and “effortless”. Something
that belongs to “me”. That in itself is a sufficient reason for giving
in to it. Hence, it’s not incidental that the Buddha often compared
sensuality to a “bait”.</p>
<p>If one contemplates the necessity of the living healthy body for
<em>any</em> sensual engagements (fleeting or otherwise), it can be
discerned that even the pleasures that one can gain from it
<em>belong</em> to the actual <em>sense organs</em>. As in: pleasures
are inseparable and inconceivable without them. Thus, if one wants to
overcome the entire domain of sensuality, one can do so by overcoming
the <em>ownership</em> of the sense organs (or the <em>body</em> as a
whole). And extinguishing of the ownership, i.e. the necessary condition
of sensuality, is done by understanding that it was impossible to own
the body in the first place. If that were not so, then one’s desires
would <em>already</em> be all satisfied (i.e. there would be no desires
to begin with). Alternatively, one can contemplate that if one were the
true master and owner of one’s own body, that body would not be a
<em>subject</em> to illness, aging and death. It would not be
<em>liable</em> to accidents, elements, circumstances, etc. This kind of
understanding can only be properly developed on the basis of restraint
and celibacy. And once it is developed, then the restraint will become a
normal mode of behaviour. It will not be a way of “resistance” to the
sensual pull any more, because there will be no more senses that can
pull one. Senses and their respective desires are a problem only when
they are “mine”.</p>
<h3 id="peripheral-awareness">Peripheral Awareness</h3>
<p>Mindfulness done correctly is when the mind is <em>anchored</em> in
something. That something must be a thing that is not directly attended
to, but instead, has to be a <em>reference point</em> to the attended
thing (hence we call it “anchor”). If a thing is not directly attended
to but there, we call that thing to be a “background”. It’s a background
to a thing we attend (which makes that thing a “foreground”). This is
the basic principle of mindfulness, on which we can expand here
below.</p>
<p>One begins developing this practice of awareness by being mindful of
the experience as a <em>whole</em>. For example, one is mindful of
‘being-seated-on-a-chair-reading-a-Dhamma-essay’. That is one’s
<em>situation</em> at that very time. That is one’s experience as a
“whole”. This is always the necessary starting point. What is very
important is to prevent the tendency to become absorbed in one
particular thing. (Feeling, sensations or perception, and similar).
Instead, one has to broaden the mindfulness and become aware of the
<em>generality</em> of one’s current situation, without losing the sight
of the particular either.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref135" role="doc-noteref"><sup>135</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course, the attempts of discerning the background of one’s current
experience will not be perfect in the beginning. One will more often
than not fall into a mistake of over-attending one’s experience as a
whole. This is a mistake of making that background into an
<em>object</em> of one’s attention, defining it, clarifying it, trying
to keep it in front. These are all ways of making it a
<em>foreground</em>, which means that then something else will be in
place of the background.</p>
<p>The natural tendency is to ask “<em>What</em> is then the
background?”. This is however a wrong question. And it’s wrong because
we are not concerned with the <em>content</em> of the background (or
foreground for that matter), which would be the answer to “what?”.
Instead our concern should be with <em>nature</em> of it. So one needs
to restrain the tendency to clarify <em>what</em> is that “background”,
and learn how to start discerning the domain of it. The domain of the
“<em>periphery</em>”, its nature, in regard to what is presently
<em>enduring</em> here.</p>
<p>Thus, something one attends to directly is what a foreground is at
the time. It can be anything that is the current object of one’s
attention. That thing has manifested, and it is enduring as such. That’s
the basic structural property of one’s experience, there is no problem
with this. However, if one wants to develop mindfulness, a step further
is necessary. That step is developing the peripheral “vision” in regard
to that very same foreground object, but <em>without</em> making that
peripheral vision the new object by <em>directly</em> attending to it.
The Buddha referred to this as “<em>yoniso manasikara</em>”, which is
often translated as “proper attention”. <em>Yoniso manasikara</em> is
the correct way of attending to the peripheral. <em>Manasikara</em>
means “attention”. <em>Yoni</em> means “womb”. So when a thing is
present in the front, in the foreground, its peripheral background is
that very “womb” the thing has “came from”, so to speak. <em>Yoniso
manasikara</em> is womb-attention, or less literally: a peripheral
attention.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>136</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, the point is to learn <em>how</em> to attend. Not so much
“what”. It’s about discerning the habit of “over-attending” and learning
how to not resort to it. This habit manifests through either indulging
or resisting the object of one’s attention. Either way, one is fully
concerned with it. This is why one must stop trying to “observe” one’s
experience as an object of one’s attention and instead, acknowledge it
and let it <em>endure</em> on its own. (Let it persist or
change-while-remaining-the-same-thing). Once the arisen experience of
one’s attention is allowed to be, then gradually and indirectly,
discerning of the peripheral <em>domain</em> can manifest.</p>
<p>The most practical way of practising this is through mindfulness of
body postures. That’s why these things are often called “foundations” of
mindfulness, or “anchors” or “reference points”. It’s because they are
<em>always</em> rooted in the <em>background</em>. (E.g. foundations are
<em>under</em>; an anchor is at the <em>bottom</em>; the reference point
is at the <em>distance</em>. Under, bottom, away… it means
‘not-here-directly-in-front-of-me’). So for example: while I’m seated,
I’m reading an article, actively scrolling through the pages, paying
attention to what’s being said in it. Things I’m “doing”, like reading,
writing, talking, etc. are things I’m attending to (foreground). And I’m
attending to them all <em>while</em> I’m <em>seated</em>. That’s the
reference point that is enough for proper mindfulness. That is what’s
the background here. Yet, if I switch my attention and start attending
to the fact that I’m sitting on the chair, then the body posture of
“sitting” ceases to be the background in my experience. Why? Because
I’ve broken the relationship of “referencing”. There is no more
“<em>while</em>”, since I forgot about the reading, and became concerned
with sitting. When this happens, one can either go back to the original
foreground, or discern the newly present background in regard to the
attended experience of sitting. The new background will have to be
something even more <em>general</em> than “sitting posture”. And the
more general thing in that case is nothing other than awareness of the
“body there”.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>137</sup></a></p>
<p>Body postures are more general than attending to a particular action
or perception. But having a “body <em>there</em>” is even more general
than the postures. Because to be walking, sitting, standing or lying
down, one needs to have a <em>body</em> in the first place. That’s why
one can also use the knowledge of “there is body”, as the peripheral
anchor for one’s daily actions and experiences. The presence of one’s
living body is a fundamental requirement for <em>any</em> action. We can
go even higher (even more general), as we mentioned earlier, and develop
awareness of the phenomenon of Earth, Water, Fire or Air. Or even
further, in the practice of more refined <em>kasinas</em>, as described
in the <em>Suttas</em>. The point is that the principle remains the
same.</p>
<p>We need to stress that this is something that requires
<em>development</em>. It’s not something that can be just “figured out”,
or read once and made sense of. It requires a diligent
<em>repetition</em> of “stepping back” when over-attending one’s
experience as a whole. And then “stepping in” when ignoring it
(under-attending it, forgetting about the background). So, it takes time
and effort in order for it to be correctly <em>discerned</em> and
<em>recognized</em>.</p>
<p>The problem with common practice of meditation is that people are
encouraged to get “absorbed” into the particular “meditation object”.
The practice becomes a form of focusing on the foreground at the expense
of everything else. And not just that, people end up focusing on the
objects twice as hard. This is because their view of meditation is to
look and <em>perceive</em> the “momentary” foreground (the whole idea of
“observing ‘<em>sensations</em>’”). Then within that they try to
perceive even more <em>particular</em> things. So it’s not just the
<em>domain</em> of the foreground, but the content proliferates further
too. In cases like this, the ‘background’, as a foundation of
mindfulness that needs to be understood, is even further obscured.</p>
<p>The ‘reference point’ means being aware of something, without having
to actively think about it. That’s the basic principle of mindfulness.
This should <em>always</em> be the basis for <em>samadhi</em> (according
to the <em>Suttas</em>).<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref138" role="doc-noteref"><sup>138</sup></a> That is why, if
mindfulness and awareness is practised correctly, it will result in
<em>knowledge</em> of the nature of things. The very definition of
knowledge is knowing something without having to actively think about
it. The knowledge reappears when it is attended to. One knows what one
knows. This is the important point because this type of mindfulness of
the background that’s simultaneous with the presently arisen
phenomenon<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>139</sup></a>, results in the establishment of
mind (<em>samadhi</em>) that transcends <em>sensuality</em> and <em>ill
will</em>. The whole domain (scope) of unwholesome.<a href="#fn140"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140" role="doc-noteref"><sup>140</sup></a>
And that’s why that <em>samadhi</em> further results in complete
knowledge of liberation.</p>
<p>The catch is in persistent effort of repetition of <em>learning</em>
how to <em>attend</em> to things <em>peripherally</em>, without having
to “directly” look at them. For a mind affected with <em>avijja</em>,
the “direct look”, the “<em>ayoniso manasikara</em>” always involves
<em>appropriation</em> and the <em>Self-view</em>. And “learning to
attend” things peripherally can be done on many different “bases” or
“domains” that are structurally present as the background of our
attended experience. These domains are the domain of feelings, thoughts,
and even one’s intentions (bodily, verbal and mental).</p>
<p>For example, being aware of the <em>general feeling</em> present,
without trying to <em>perceive</em> it as “sensation” (i.e. “in” the
body), is another way of establishing the proper mindfulness.</p>
<p>Or, something we often talk about, taking up of personal
<em>responsibility</em>. If one takes it up, then no matter what the
engagement with the particular task is, the background of it (the “womb”
of that engagement) is one’s own <em>choice</em> to engage with it in
the first place. Taking up responsibility, means becoming aware of the
“background” choices one makes throughout one’s life.<a href="#fn141"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
<p>Furthermore, taking up responsibility for what one has chosen, a
person gets to maintain that mindfulness through the very particular
actions one is doing on account of it. And that mindfulness of
responsibility is not something they would have to perpetually think
about. No, that mindfulness is being <em>felt</em> instead. (That’s why
the initial awareness of <em>any</em> form of responsibility is always
<em>unpleasant</em> and concerning).</p>
<p>The choice behind one’s actions is a general <em>unity</em>, a
<em>context</em> of one’s acts, that is present in each of those acts
individually. Present as a peripheral background. It is because of this
that <em>sila</em> or <em>virtue</em> is a necessary prerequisite for
understanding. When one’s actions are based on <em>distortions</em> of
priority (particular sensuality <em>over</em> general nature of choice
regarding it, for example), one cannot see a clear responsible
background while engaged in such pursuits. No perspective, so to speak.
So, first actions that maintain absorptions with particularity must be
divorced from the unwholesome domain. Then they must be further
restrained, by avoiding the distracting of oneself. By undoing wrong way
of attending to things. By not cultivating improper attention. Only then
can one begin to discern the <em>signs</em> of the peripheral,
characteristics of the background hereby discussed. Only then one will
be able to “grasp the sign of one’s mind” or <em>cittanimitta</em>. A
necessary requirement for the arising of the Right view.</p>

<p>Bring your attention to your heart. It’s situated almost at the
centre of your torso, to the left just under the rib cage. Sense its
movements. Notice the beat, the rhythm, the muscular throb, the squish
and pump of blood.</p>
<p>If that piece of moving flesh were to stop or miss a beat, your
breathing would stop, you would pass out and away or you might just have
a tiny stroke, leaving you handicapped for many years to come. Your life
would change, either a little or a lot. Your plans for tomorrow would
cease, your skills would mean nothing, your lifestyle would be affected.
Your family or friends and your deepest prayers will not make that piece
of flesh in your chest keep working if it just stops. The heart cannot
hear you, it is not aware of your intentions, your missions, your loves
or hates. It just pumps blood…not for you or even itself, it just pumps
blood. It doesn’t have a personality, it is not personally invested in
anything that you do. It is an impersonal piece of flesh which your life
is directly and structurally, dependent on.</p>
<p>The heart organ in your chest is inaccessible to you. Even if you
were, through the marvels of modern medical science, able to physically
open up your chest and not bleed to death, you would still find a heart
organ which you would have no internal access to. You could touch it,
but you cannot create it or control it directly. Which means that you
can affect it only secondarily, but you cannot choose the heart’s rhythm
and beat to determine your life status or not, it does so whether you
like it or not. It determines your life, and without it, your choices
cannot occur.</p>
<p>Attend to the heart, really get a good overall sense of its movement
and weight….and now with full intent, choose for it to stop beating.</p>
<p>What you will discover is that you are “outside” of it, even though
you would say that it is inside of you. That core of your personal body
is inaccessible to you, it is not yours to control, it is not you. Your
overall sense of body is undermined by a thing which is not yours and
which it relies upon for its life. Such a REVEALation highlights this
gratuitous assumption that “the body is mine, or is my-self”. It reveals
a contradiction, you assume the body to be yours, yet it is anything but
yours. You realise, “My whole sense of self is situated on top of, or

anywhere.”</p>

that there in the background is a heart which is determining your
activities. Once that situation becomes clearer, try to understand what

<p>You could also try and pay attention to the beating heart directly,

beating that I am attending to, and just how dependent this heart here
is on those things working well for it to be. Let the meaning of that

<p>Pay attention to the heart again. Where does its energy come from? Do
you have access to that? You can of course imagine or make up some story
about where the energy or <em>life forc</em>e comes from, but that would
only be done because you cannot sit with the fact that you don’t know
where it comes from. That uncertainty reveals the deeper meaning of your
situation, which in turn makes you feel very uncomfortable, and so you
try to get rid of that discomfort by telling yourself a story to make
yourself feel better about your existence which is not your own.</p>
<p>What if that <em>energy</em> stops? Then the heart will stop moving.
The heart then is also not its own. It too is dependent upon that which
it is not in its control. And so if I do not even have access to the
heart organ in this body, what is to say about that which the heart
depends on?</p>
<p>That energy, the activation, the life force, one could call
consciousness, the animaton of things, the presence of things. That
energy is not known without that which is energised, such as the heart.
I couldn’t know about the “heart energy” if there was no moving fleshy
piece of meat. I can try to fantasise about the origin of that energy
and call it god, biology, or whatever else, but that would just be
another assumption used to cover up the reality that that particular
energy is completely inaccessible to me while I am intimately dependent
upon it. Both the fleshy heart and its <em>energy</em> do not know me,

<p>That <em>energy</em> which the body depends on, is itself dependent
on the body being available. Neither aspect of this situation as a whole
can be seen or known as independently arisen, and any independence is a
complete fantasy on my part, an assumption on account of the pressuring
ambiguity of my existence which is not in my control.</p>
<hr />
<p>Take for example a computer game which can have a third person view
of some character, walking in the bottom centre of the screen. That in a
way, is how one should try and view one’s first person viewpoint, such a
viewpoint would be a right type of viewing. A way of seeing and knowing
this situation that you are framed by. In life, you can see other
people, over there or near you, and they are not what you think you are.
They are others who are “over there”, and likewise is your body to
others, the same way their bodies are to you - “an other over there”. No
matter how close they appear. Your body is on the same plain of the
other bodies you do not own. Your body is equally not owned by you.</p>
<p>If I can take this body which happens to be very close to this point
of view, as for me, or belonging to me, as self, I can also take other
bodies and things which are a little bit further away, like cars, house,
wife, child, cattle, wealth, country, and so on, i.e my sense of
ownership, my self has no limits, it can take everything personally. If
I can assume that a part of this nama-rupa domain, which is not-mine, as
mine, then I can assume any part of that domain to be mine or for
me.</p>
<p>Take, again the example of a computer game, where you’re playing a
character. That game is dependent upon electricity. When there is no
electricity there is no game. The electricity helps to animate the game,
it is not the game, yet is essential to it. These computer games can be
played from a first person point of view, whereby you just see the arms
and legs, etc. Such a point of view is the way we view the world, but it
would be useful to try and view our first person point of view in a
third person point of view manner, an ability to self-reflect, to
mentally step back and be aware of the situation as a whole while we go
about our day. However, unlike the game that we are outside of, this
life, we are inside of, we are inside as the assumption of ownership. We
are not outside. Our assumption of self cannot be found anywhere else
except here, surrounded by the situation as a whole. We only know this
which we are completely surrounded by, and to think that there is
outside of this or that we are enclosed and separated from a greater
external reality which is beyond this, means that we are assuming a
reality, we are imagining a reality which cannot be known and thus
living in delusion. The reality that we are imagining beyond
<em>this</em> is nowhere else to be found except here as an assumption
in regard to this situation and its components.</p>
<p>Therefore, this sense of self, being second to the situation as a
whole, being <em>dependent upon</em> an assumption of ownership in
regard to this situation as a whole, is <em>unownable</em>. It is
dependently manifested, not self-manifested . It depends on there being
a situation as a whole, operating, on its own. My self, then, is not my
own because the things which my self depends on for its existence,
<em>cannot</em> be my own.</p>
<p>Sense the rhythm of the heart throughout your day, tune into its
meaning of <em>anicca-dukkha-anatta</em>, and let your <em>Self</em>
fall apart.</p>

<p>“And what is ‘assumption’? There are these four kinds of assumptions.
The assumption of sensual pleasures, the assumption of views, the
assumption regarding the adherence to precepts and duties <em>(i.e,

<p><u>Bodily pain and mental suffering</u></p>
<p>Having a body means that one will experience pleasure and pain but
that does not mean that the mind is bound to be emotionally affected, as
in, the various forms of joy or misery that appear simultaneously with
what is felt, are gratuitously arisen, they are not what a feeling is
but are consequences of assuming what a feeling is, and so to bring an
end to that emotional suffering, one has to remove that assumption.</p>
<p>Not knowing that there is an assumption regarding a feeling, one
delights in or resists it, and to that extent, depending on the
intensity of the feeling, a corresponding emotion is also present. When
the assumption is removed, then no matter the intensity of the feeling,
no emotional suffering is possible.</p>
<p>The gratuitous assumption is that a feeling is “for me, mine, and
myself”. That assumption cannot easily be removed by merely believing
that whatever is felt is not mine. Even though the belief is accurate,
that nature of feeling not being mine needs to be clarified through
repeated contemplation and real-life application by way of not acting
out of craving regarding a feeling. It takes a great amount of effort to
remove such an assumption because it is literally who you are.</p>
<p>The undoing of your self-view is the only way that one can, after an
indeterminate amount of time, be free from suffering a feeling.</p>
<p>The common and natural way that a person tries to not suffer is to
manage pleasure and pain with the intent to increase the pleasure or get
rid of the pain. However, no matter how skilled one becomes at such
management, the main problem which is the gratuitous assumption of
ownership remains and as such that management can never bring liberation
from suffering because it is just another symptom of the problem,
another emotional response toward a feeling assumed as self. Acting out
emotionally by way of management so that one can no longer suffer a
feeling is a contradiction and a futile attempt because no amount of
increase in the symptoms (the emotions) will cure the disease (of
suffering). No amount of feeding the liability to suffer can cure the
liability to suffer. One could <em>manage</em> pleasure and pain by
patiently withstanding it without acting out of craving to increase or
decrease the feeling, and as such, the pressure of craving a feeling
would still be present, however, the only difference would be that as
one patiently withstands (I.e does not act out of craving), one also
simultaneously tries to remove the assumption of ownership through
clarifying the nature of feeling and by doing so the pressure of craving
(suffering) would diminish. That would be <em>Middle-way
management</em>, which also helps you cope but it destroys the problem,
as opposed to emotional management which only helps you cope with the
problem you keep feeding.</p>
<p>One can restrain oneself from acting out angrily and succeed but such
restraint will not uproot the problem from causing more symptoms that
stem from ‘identification with feeling and craving against pain’ to
arise again. The restraint is necessary but understanding is crucial if
one wants to no longer need restraint management.</p>
<p>Many parents learn management skills from raising their young, they
learn to endure the burden of discomfort through various coping
mechanisms, and as a result, can take on a lot more pain. However,
despite that type of discipline, they still get angry, they still have
to try to be patient, and still have to employ some kind of management
technique in which to cope with their internal resistance towards pain,
their anger - their suffering.</p>
<p>Coping with one’s mental anguish is good but not good enough because
it means that one is still not exempt from suffering, it just means that
one has learned how to cope within the given parameters. The problem is
that those parameters do not stay the same. Circumstances change and can
bring various challenges that one may not be able to handle. Challenges
that could overwhelm even the most hardened individual. Take the case of
a military person who can deal with many life-threatening painful
situations, who can put their bodies through extreme pains, yet the loss
of a loved one will bring them to tears, from which they may never
recover. Despite enduring vast amounts of pain, there may still arise a
pain so tremendous that one cannot mentally cope.</p>
<p><u>Delighting in the body, one’s mind is obstructed</u></p>
<p>Another assumption that the common untrained person has is that this
body is “for me, mine, myself”. With such an assumption, attention is
then absorbed into sensory experiences. This means that when the body is
tired - the mind is clouded, when the body is heated - the mind is
lustful, when the body is in a neutral state - the mind is bored, when
the body is agitated - the mind is annoyed. When the mind is absorbed
with delight into the wild and untamed senses, the mind is hindered by
them, it is overwhelmed by lust, anger, restlessness, dullness,
confusion, and so on.</p>
<p>Delighting in the body means that one’s mind gets dragged around by
the body and as such one’s mental well-being is founded upon the bodily
state which is prone to change, which means for that person, equilibrium
of mind and long-term happiness is not a realistic goal. At most, they
can only undergo happiness or a sense of success for as long as there is
a comforting or pleasurable sense object manifesting for them.</p>
<p>How then can one be at peace no matter the bodily state or present
feeling? How to not suffer no matter what?</p>
<p><u>Adopting a view to cope with suffering</u></p>
<p>I could hope that everything will work out in the end. I could think
that bodily death will result in my eternal happiness. But none of those
beliefs or assumptions will result in an assurance, here and now, that I
am free from suffering or that I will never suffer again. Those beliefs
only help me cope once again with the fact that I suffer now, that I am
still susceptible to suffering, and that I do not know how to escape
such a situation.</p>
<p>I can resign to ideas like: “Such is life. That’s the way it is. This
too will change. God has a plan, etc”, and on account of those
concessions, I will feel some relief which doesn’t last very long, so I
will have to repeat those ideas like mantras, or scroll for another
uplifting quote, trying once again to help myself get along with the
fact that I do and can suffer.</p>
<p>What then is the escape from being subject to suffering? How can I no
longer need coping mechanisms? The common way to try and escape
suffering is through chasing a pleasant feeling, which results in one
trying to set up assurances through insurance policies, savings,
investments, vows of fidelity, dietary programs, skill acquisitions,
meditation programs, exercise routines, family development, property
acquisition, and any other form of ownership that will seemingly give
the result of having permanent access to pleasure. One goes about trying
to control the situation, trying to stabilize the unstable, through the
proliferation of ownership for the everlasting access to pleasure, which
is one’s only relief plan from the fundamental discomfort of existence
taken personally.</p>
<p><u>Acquisition and distraction</u></p>
<p>Those attempts at management rely on the fact that one is subject to
suffering. If one was no longer liable, then those attempts, those
various investments would no longer be emotionally needed. But as we
know, even if a person can own a vast empire, or control many things,
his acquisitions are based on a situation that is already out of his
control, a situation that is fundamentally unownable, thus his attempt
to own and control, and likewise with his adherence to certain
meditation techniques or spiritual practices and views. If he were to
reflect on this fundamental futile undertaking, he would most likely
drown in sorrow. Therefore various ‘acts of distraction’ that give him a
sense of security and help him from not facing the truth, become
priceless. Such is the value of the entertainment industry or the
significance of industry in general. (music, movies, culinary
explorations, travel, art, socializing, building, planning, religion,
retreats….)</p>
<p>All industry then can be seen as an attempt to satisfy one’s need for
freedom from suffering, yet the industry is built upon that suffering.
It is fueled by the existence of one’s personal liability to suffer, and
to stop such industrious activities, would result in one coming face to
face with one’s suffering that one has been trying to outrun. Hence the
apprehension of having nothing to do, the fear of solitude, stillness,
or peace.</p>
<p>So once again, how to solve this problem? Should we stop all
activities? No, because not all activities fuel the problem. It is only
the activities of acting out of craving and holding an assumption that
needs to be stopped for the problem to an end.</p>
<p><u>Managing my personal feelings is no cure</u></p>
<p>Our management acts such as chasing pleasure will never end in
contentment because there will always be a need for more since pleasures
to be had are infinite and subject to change. However, despite the
nature of feeling being so evident yet subtle, we do not know it and
therefore the assumption that the only way to escape suffering is
pleasure is maintained and fueled by the assumption of ownership of
feeling, even though it’s obvious that feeling is not mine because if it
were I wouldn’t be chasing it down. Such is the ordinary absurd mode of
existence.</p>
<p>If pleasure is the escape from suffering then how much of it is
required to result in never craving pleasure again?</p>
<p>One can think of all the pleasures that one has had and see that it
hasn’t worked out because still, you are subject to suffering. This
realization could leave you discouraged, this realization that you
cannot get all the pleasures that you desire and therefore it would be
impossible for you to be free from suffering… “Unless I win the
lottery!”, you may think, which might give you some glimmer of hope,
“Maybe just one big boost of pleasure would solve the problem?</p>
<p>If you are at least understanding that the pleasures that could be
had are infinite and your assumption that “pleasure is the escape from
suffering”, will result in a never-ending story of dissatisfaction
because of pleasure being in its nature subject to change and
un-ownable, then you should investigate further, for example, “Is
pleasure even necessary in the first place? I chase pleasure because I
think that,”Without it, I will continue to suffer”, so it seems vital.
One assumes that it will cure ones suffering, but then when pleasure
arises it is felt as though it’s not enough, and then it ceases sometime
later and my suffering remains unchanged, which means that the pleasure
that I worked so hard for, did not remedy my liability to suffering or
even decrease its existence in any way. Therefore, pain is not the cause
of my liability to suffering, because experiencing pleasure is not the
cure. When I feel pleasure, I suffer for it to be, when I feel pain, I
suffer for it to not be. Either way, my liability to suffer remains
steady.</p>
<p><u>What exactly is the cause of my suffering?</u></p>
<p>When I suffer, I crave for it to disappear. That attitude, subtle as
it is, is an attempt to get away from suffering, and so from the start,
on that level, I begin the hopeless activity of trying to get rid of
suffering by fueling it through my blind act of devotion towards chasing
pleasure and contempt for pain.</p>
<p>One who has some self-reflexive abilities might then begin to
challenge those gratuitous assumptions that pleasure is good and that it
results in non-suffering, or that pain is bad, that it causes one to
suffer and must be gotten rid of by any means necessary especially by
the means of pleasure which is fundamentally good because that is what I
am.</p>
<p>Is pleasure really good? Is it mine? We can already see that it
carries no usefulness as a means of escape from suffering and no amount
of assumed ownership changes that. Is pain the source of our suffering?
We can see through these reflections that if the pain is the source,
then escape is impossible because pain is always possible despite
experiencing pleasure.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, when someone suffers pain, they automatically try to get
rid of it, because they fundamentally, without question, don’t want to
feel it and assume that pain is the problem and pleasure is the
solution. Failing to see that if that were the case, they would already
no longer have a problem and therefore no longer need a solution.</p>
<p>There is pain and there will be pain. If I had a say in that, there
would be no pain, to begin with, but there is pain, therefore I have no
say in that. And when I resist it, I suffer it. When I try to make it
not be, when I think that the pain which is not in my control, is in my
control, I foolishly maintain my suffering. Again, if it were mine to
control, then it would not exist in the first place.</p>
<p>One can realize that this pain, which has arisen by whatever means it
has arisen, is not mine because it has appeared. I feel it but I do not
own it. This type of contemplation helps one to restart, so to speak,
from a place of what is true rather than from a place of assumption, or
ignorance, and if we want to get down to the bottom of our suffering to
uproot its cause, then we have to start seeing what we are doing wrong,
we need to see what is occurring and this requires us to not
automatically react by struggling to get rid of pain and delighting in
pleasures and to be honest with ourselves about the failure in the
previous means by which we were trying to be free from suffering.</p>
<p>I can delight in pleasure and I can hate pain, but either way
pleasure and pain will arise and my delight and hate will not make any
difference but will maintain the fact that when there is a feeling, and
there is always a feeling, I will be emotionally affected one way or
another.</p>
<p>All this means is that suffering is not caused by what is felt, but
is rooted in my gratuitous assumption of ownership and my attitude
towards it. If I did not resist my pain, I could not have an emotional
state of anger, which requires resistance against my pain. If I did not
delight in my pleasure, I could not have an emotional state of passion,
which requires delighting in my pleasure.</p>
<p><u>Detachment from feeling</u></p>
<p>Feeling arises and ceases due to conditions that are also not my own,
and while that happens, I am never its owner, my attitude of resistance
towards it provides me with no protection from suffering and makes it
worse, and things are only bad because I have unknowingly made them so
through my gratuitous assumptions about what I am experiencing.</p>
<p>A feeling manifests blind to our attitudes, emotions, and sense of
ownership. A feeling doesn’t even know we exist, and how could it, it is
just a feeling that feels.</p>
<p>Such realizations and repeated considerations along the right lines
of the Middle-way application will slowly result in detachment from
feeling i.e, the letting go of feeling through the destruction of
assumptions. Such an indirect letting go of what is felt, on account of
understanding that one can never hold on in the first place, directly
results in an increase in non-agitation regarding an arisen feeling, it
results in a more peaceful mind and body which are no longer emotionally
charged up through an assumption of ownership and desperate attempts to
control what is felt. The feeling is just left alone and one is no
longer touched by it, so to speak, because one no longer touches it by
taking it personally.</p>

a painful feeling, and a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. The
instructed noble disciple also feels a pleasant feeling, a painful
feeling, and a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Therein, bhikkhus,
what is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between the
instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed common person?”….</p>
<p>…“Bhikkhus, when the uninstructed common person is being contacted by
a painful feeling, he sorrows, grieves, and laments; he weeps, beating
his breast, and becomes distraught. He feels two feelings—a bodily one
and a mental one. Suppose they were to strike a man with a dart, and
then they would strike him immediately afterward with a second dart so
that the man would feel a feeling caused by two darts. Similarly, when
the uninstructed common person is being contacted by a painful feeling …
he feels two feelings—a bodily one and a mental one.</p>
<p>“Being contacted by that same painful feeling, he harbors aversion
towards it. When he harbors aversion toward painful feeling, the
underlying tendency to aversion toward painful feeling lies behind this.
Being contacted by a painful feeling, he seeks delight in sensual
pleasure. For what reason? Because the uninstructed ordinary person does
not know of any escape from painful feeling other than sensual pleasure.
When he seeks delight in sensual pleasure, the underlying tendency to
passion for pleasant feeling lies behind this. He does not understand as
it is the appearance and the disappearance, the gratification, the
danger, and the escape in the case of these feelings. When he does not
understand these things, the underlying tendency to ignorance regarding
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling lies behind this.</p>
<p>“If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it attached. If he feels a
painful feeling, he feels it attached. If he feels a
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he feels it attached. This,
bhikkhus, is called an uninstructed common person who is attached to
birth, aging, and death; who is attached to sorrow, lamentation, pain,
displeasure, and despair; who is attached to suffering, I say.</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, when the instructed noble disciple is contacted by a
painful feeling, he does not sorrow, grieve, or lament; he does not
weep, beat his breast, and become distraught. He feels one feeling—a
bodily one, not a mental one. Suppose they were to strike a man with a
dart, but they would not strike him immediately afterward with a second
dart so that the man would feel a feeling caused by one dart only.
Similarly, when the instructed noble disciple is contacted by a painful
feeling … he feels one feeling—a bodily one, not a mental one.</p>
<p>“Being contacted by that same painful feeling, he harbors no aversion
towards it. Since he harbors no aversion toward painful feeling, the
underlying tendency to aversion toward painful feeling does not lie
behind this. Being contacted by a painful feeling, he does not seek
delight in sensual pleasure. For what reason? Because the instructed
noble disciple knows of an escape from painful feeling other than
sensual pleasure. Since he does not seek delight in sensual pleasure,
the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feeling does not lie behind
this. He understands as it is the appearance and the disappearance, the
gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of these feelings.
Since he understands these things, the underlying tendency to ignorance
regarding neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling does not lie behind
this.</p>
<p>“If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it detached. If he feels a
painful feeling, he feels it detached. If he feels a

bhikkhus, is called a noble disciple who is detached from birth, aging,
and death; who is detached from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure,

<p>“This, bhikkhus, is the distinction, the disparity, the difference
between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed common
person.”</p>
<p>The wise one, knowledgeable, does not feel the pleasant and painful
mental feeling. This is the great difference between the wise one and
the ordinary person.</p>
<p>For the knowledgeable one who has comprehended Dhamma, who clearly
sees this world and the next, desirable things do not provoke his mind,
and towards the undesired, he has no aversion.</p>

<h3 id="making-peace-with-feeling">Making Peace With Feeling</h3>
<p>By making peace with what is felt, one is developing <em>metta</em>
or non-ill will. By that I mean, no longer interfering with what is
felt, by no longer trying to change it, but by withstanding it, by not
craving it, by fully comprehending it.</p>
<p>When you feel pleasure, your default mode is to try and keep it, you
want it to stay, you try to increase it because it does not feel
adequate, there is something about it that just isn’t satisfying you,
yet it is ‘pleasure’, it is already enough of what it is in itself. In
other words, pleasure is not good enough for you, you crave for it to be
more, to last longer, and so on.</p>
<p>Your delighting in pleasure will not make you content, because it’s
an agitated attempt to keep pleasure, it’s a holding on to something
which is not yours and impossible to make your own. Such an act is not
only lustful but also aversive and ignorant, an act of wanting things to
be the way you want them to be and not the way they are.</p>
<p>When you feel pain, your default mode is to try to get rid of it, to
decrease it. Yet it is the way it is and your attempt to change it is
again not peaceful, it’s not kind, not compassionate, not content, not
equanimous. You don’t want pain so you seek pleasure but when you get
it, still you are not satisfied. After all, it can never be yours. Your
gratuitous attitude of craving can never be satisfied no matter what you
put in front of it. Its nature is to be unfulfilled.</p>
<p>You want the pain to change and you want pleasure not to change. You
want <em>anicca</em> and you don’t want <em>anicca</em>. Wanting
<em>anicca</em> is wanting <em>dukkha</em>. This wanting or interfering
with feeling which changes is maintaining your liability to be affected
by feeling, which means you will never be peaceful, your mind will be
dragged around with feeling in whichever way it goes. This wanting and
touching feeling means that you will always be affected by it. In other
words, you love when it’s pleasant and hate when it’s unpleasant. You
are on and will continue to be on an emotional rollercoaster because you
take feelings personally, you are holding them.</p>
<p>By detaching from a feeling through understanding its nature, and by
no longer touching it with your attitude of wanting/craving, by way of
not acting out of intentions based on greed, hate, or delusion, the
feeling will not affect you anymore, you will be unable to love and
therefore unable to hate. Your mental state will be brought to
equilibrium, peace, and <em>upekkha</em>.</p>
<p>The reason I am emphasizing having the attitude of <em>metta</em>
towards what is felt is because it’s a refined act of non-craving, which
if sustained, will eventually result in there being no possibility of
hating anyone, because the only reason you find another person or
situation irritating to the point of hatred, is because you hate the
pain that has arisen and you long for the pleasure that is forever out
of your control.</p>
<p><u><strong>Love or non-hate.</strong></u></p>
<p>The problem that you can encounter if you think the <em>metta</em>
practice taught in the suttas by the Buddha, is the practice of love, is
that you will continue to delight in pleasure dependent on the senses,
which means you will also hate or be irritated when there is not enough
of it. The degree to which you love is the degree to which you can
hate.</p>
<p><em>Metta</em> is not about love but non-hate. It’s a quality that a
great friend has. They can never hate you because they cannot love you.
They are not emotionally dependent on feelings, their minds are
undisturbed, peaceful, and therefore can be of great benefit to another
who is clouded by love and hate or affected by feelings. No matter what
you do, they see clearly when you do not. Their benevolence, their
<em>metta</em> is “unconditioned”.</p>
<p><em>Metta</em> when fully developed becomes <em>upekkha</em>,
complete peaceful detachment, and that cannot come about when you are
doing something which is not peaceful, like fighting or even delighting
in pleasure desperately holding on to it so that it doesn’t change. That
is not the path of peace or renunciation.</p>
<p>Renunciation of pleasure means not interfering with it, renunciation
of pain means not interfering with it. Renunciation means
non-craving.</p>
<p>When there is pain practice <em>metta</em> towards that. When there
is pleasure, practice <em>metta</em> towards that, not wanting it to
stay or change, i.e. unconditional friendliness.</p>
<p>If you want to practice <em>metta</em> for the uprooting of the cause
of suffering, then you must let go of the feeling, let it be what it is,
patiently withstand it, without interfering, and then you will be in a
good position to see its nature, which is <em>agitating</em>. All
feeling agitates and by holding on to it, by touching it, you are
agitated, sometimes a lot as with pain or only a little as with
pleasure, either way, feeling is an agitation. You can then realize that
there is no such thing as pleasure, there are only different degrees of
pain, and all this time, what you thought was pleasure was just less
pain, and due to that assumption you held on to it as yours, as
yourself, and thus were affected by its agitated nature.</p>
<p>The more you let go of your craving regarding a feeling the less it
will affect you and the more peaceful/<em>upekkha</em> you become. This
means that no matter what happens in life, no matter how much pain is
‘caused to you by another being’, you will be peaceful, and you will not
be able to get angry, hateful, or irritated. Your mind will be a
<em>brahmavihara</em>/a heavenly place because you removed the cause of
love and hate from it.</p>

<li id="fn3"><p>For a puthujjana it is not enough to see this once. It
is only with the repetition of this insight (achieved through effort),
that the habitual view of control will disappear, and be replaced
(gradually too) with the view of an inherent lack of control – the view
of impermanence. When it is seen that impermanence underlies every
project of the Self, the Self ceases to be Self, since without its
mastery, selfhood cannot stand. (Cf. Ñāṇavīra Thera, Notes on Dhamma,
PARAMATTHA SACCA, para. 6)<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Cf. Maurice Merleau-Ponty, in his Phenomenology of
Perception, (Routledge Classics, 2007, p. 82): I detach myself from my
experience and pass to the idea. Like the object, the idea purports to
be the same for everybody, valid in all times and places, and the
individuation of an object in an objective point of time and space
finally appears as the expression of a universal positing power. I am no
longer concerned with my body, nor with time, nor with the world, as I
experience them in antepredicative knowledge, in the inner communion
that I have with them. I now refer to my body only as a idea, to the
universe as idea, to the idea of space and the idea of time. Thus
‘objective’ thought (in Kierkegaard’s sense) is formed – being that of
common sense and of science – which finally causes us to lose contact
with perceptual experience, of which it is nevertheless the outcome and
the natural sequel. The whole life of consciousness is characterized by
the tendency to posit objects, since it is consciousness, that is to say
self-knowledge, only in so far as it takes hold of itself and draws
itself together in an identifiable object. And yet the absolute positing
of a single object is the death of consciousness, since it congeals the
whole of existence, as a crystal placed in a solution suddenly
crystallizes it.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Time, as a phenomena in one’s experience, is regarded as
more primordial (read – ‘permanent’), than the experience of things. The
things seem to come and go, while the sense of time stays.<a
href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Furthermore, nothing obliges us to think that
‘manifestation of aggregates’ refers to the event of coming-out-of-womb.
The Buddha has said that “when mother and father come together and the
mother is in season and the one to be tied is present, with the coming
together of these three things, there is descent into the womb” (M. 38/i
265-66). Thus, the five-aggregates are already manifested, in a way,
even at the stage of an embryo, and before the infant is formed. (Cf.
also A.III, 61/i, 176-7)<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>And therefore it is not accidental that this is most
commonly regarded as birth.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>This, in itself, is clearly impossible, since the
“exactness”, in any area of science, is determined by the capacities of
one’s perception (i.e. the refinement of our technology and
observational instruments). (Cf. Ñāṇavīra Thera, Notes on Dhamma,
FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURE, Static Aspect, para. 16.)<a href="#fnref8"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>It is very unlikely that the whole of humanity could
actually agree on this (or anything), since all people are not the same.
The birth of a baby, in this case, carries different significance for
different individuals. A mother might say that her baby was born the
moment she held it in her arms, and that it was conceived the moment she
fell in love with its father. A scientist, in his carefully cultivated
attitude of disinterestedness, might say that a baby is conceived when
embryo cells become discernible (he observes it under his microscope!),
and perhaps that it is born when it starts to breathe independently. For
a doctor, involved in performing abortions, there is no question of
‘baby’ (i.e. ‘human’), until three months are due. Thus, it is how one
feels towards ‘birth’, how one perceives it, how one intends it, that
determines what that birth is for him. (“Contacted, monks, one feels;
contacted, one intends; contacted, one perceives.” – Saḷāyatana
Saṃyutta, iv,10.) Also, compare the passage from the Madhupiṇḍika Sutta,
M. 18/i 111-112:</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>Dependent on the eye and forms (ear, nose…) eye consciousness arise.
The meeting of three is contact. With contact as condition there is
feeling. What man feels, that he perceives. What he perceives, that he
thinks about. What he thinks about that he diversifies. With what he
diversified as the source calculations about perceptions of
diversification occupy a man with respect to past, future and
present.</p>
</blockquote>

<a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>Compare this passage from J.P. Sartre – Existentialism
is Humanism, chapter on ‘Freedom and Responsibility’: Yet I find an
absolute responsibility for the fact that my facticity (here the fact of
my birth) is directly inapprehensible and even inconceivable, for this
fact of my birth never appears as a brute fact but always across a
projective reconstruction of my for-itself. I am ashamed of being born
or I rejoice over it, or in attempting to get rid of my life I affirm
that I live and I assume this life as bad. Thus in a certain sense I
choose to be born. This choice itself is integrally affected with
facticity since I am not able not to choose, but this facticity in turn
will appear only in so far as I surpass it toward my ends. Thus
facticity is everywhere, but inapprehensible; I never encounter anything
except my responsibility. That is why I can not ask, “Why was I born?”
or curse the day of my birth or declare that I did not ask to be born,
for these various attitudes towards my birth – i.e., toward the fact
that I realize a presence in the world – are absolutely nothing else but
ways of assuming this birth in full responsibility and of making it
mine.<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>This can be stated even more precisely: the temporal
things (events in time) are possible only because there is an atemporal
structure (nature of time) – time is secondary to one’s experience.
Hence, the p.s. is said to be akālika, ‘timeless’. (Cf. Ñāṇavīra Thera,
Notes on Dhamma, NP. &amp; FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURE). That is why, in the
Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta, M. 9, we can see that a Noble disciple can, by
understanding ‘being’, ‘birth’ or ‘ageing-and-death’ respectively, come
to the same result – complete freedom from suffering, arahatship. P.s.
can be understood by understanding all or any of its “pairs”, since each
of them represent, or rather are, the principle of simultaneous
dependent origination – ‘when this, this is’ (imasmiṃ sati idaṃ hoti).<a

<li id="fn12"><p>We are not interested in the conclusions (or lack of
them, as Ven. Ñāṇavīra would say) they drew from the method itself.<a

<li id="fn13"><p>Cf. Ñāṇavīra Thera, op. cit., NP., para. 9 &amp; 10.
This ‘somehow’ is important to note. If a puthujjana, who is not
satisfied with the idea of birth being something which occurred in his
past, admits that there has to be some other way in which ‘birth’ can be
present, and if he admits that he doesn’t see that way, he might make
the effort to find it out, and than eventually see it.<a href="#fnref13"

descriptively evident by pointing out that our everyday way of going

various modalities of”belief.” I simply take for granted that what I am
dealing with exists and is, more or less, as it presents itself as
being. Furthermore, “other actual objects are there for me as
determinate, as more or less well known, without being themselves
perceived or, indeed, present in any other mode of intuition” (Husserl

or a childhood trauma. Man is free; but his freedom does not look like

<li id="fn19"><p>For more on the everyday phenomenon of ‘inauthenticity’
see Hedigger, Being and Time, and J-P. Sartre, Being and Nothingess,
particularly the chapter on ‘Bad Faith’. See also the following lines
from Kierkegaard’s Concluding Unscientific Postscript (p. 311): “Science
organizes the moments of subjectivity within a knowledge of them, and
this knowledge is assumed to be the highest stage, and all knowledge is
an abstraction which annuls existence, a taking of the objects of
knowledge out of existence. In existence, however, such a principle does
not hold. If thought speaks deprecatingly of the imagination,
imagination in its turn speaks deprecatingly of thought; and likewise
with the feeling. The task is not to exalt the one at the expense of the
other, but to give them an equal status, to unify them in simultaneity;
the medium in which they are unified is existence.”<a href="#fnref19"

<li id="fn20"><p>Ven. Ñāṇavīra observes: “There is, however, another
point: an oriented world (which is the meaning of loka in the Suttas) is
the correlative of a point of view (there is a SN Sutta that
specifically identifies the world with the eye, ear, nose, and so on),
and consequently to deny self is to deny the world, and to assert self
is to assert the world (so loko so attā). Thus we have the following
scheme: Sassatavāda Assert a point of view; Asserts self— atthi attāti;
Assert the world; Denies the objective existence of things— sabbaṃ
natthīti Is an Idealist (Bradley, Berkeley) Uccedavāda Denies a point of
view; Denies self— natthi attāti; Denies the world; Asserts the
objective existence of things— sabbaṃ atthīti Is a Realist (Stebbing,
Russell) If this analysis is correct it would explain why a scientist,
though apparently asserting the permanence of the Universe, is, in fact,
an ucchedavādin—the Universe he asserts is without a point of view, and
is the negation of the world (= loka).”—StP, p. 186. Also, cf. DN 2, in
particular the Ajita Kesakambalin’s response.<a href="#fnref20"

<li id="fn22"><p>Obviously things can be a bit more complex than this,
inasmuch as these opposite views have a lot in common as Merleau-Ponty
observes: “We pass from absolute objectivity to absolute subjectivity,
but this second idea is not better than the first and is upheld only
against it, which means by it. The affinity between intellectualism and
empiricism is thus much less obvious and much more deeply rooted than is
commonly thought. It arises not only from the anthropological definition
of sensation used equally by both, but from the fact that both persist
in the natural or dogmatic attitude, and the survival of sensation in
intellectualism is merely a sign of this dogmatism. Intellectualism
accepts as completely valid the idea of truth and the idea of being in
which the formative work of consciousness culminates and is embodied,
and its alleged reflection consists in positing as powers of the subject
all that is required to arrive at these ideas. The natural attitude, by
throwing me into the world of things, gives me the assurance of
apprehending a ‘real’ beyond appearance, the ‘true’ beyond
illusion.”—Merleau-Ponty, Phenomenology of Perception, p. 45.<a
href="#fnref22" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn23"><p>“To have faith in the Reality of the ‘external world’,
whether rightly or wrongly; to”prove” this Reality for it, whether
adequately or inadequately; to presuppose it, whether explicitly or
not—attempts such as these which have not mastered their own basis with
full transparency, presuppose a subject which is proximally worldless or
unsure of its world, and which must, at bottom, first assure itself of a
world. Thus, from the very beginning, Being-in-a-world is disposed to
“take things” in some way [Auffassen], to suppose, to be certain, to
have faith—a way of behaving which itself is always a founded mode of
Being-in-the-world. The ‘problem of Reality’ in the sense of the
question whether an external world is present-at-hand and whether such
world can be proved, turns out to be an impossible one, not because its
consequences lead to inextricable impasses, but because the very entity
which serves as its theme, is one which, as it were, repudiates any such
formulation of the question. Our task is not to prove that an ‘external
world’ is present-at-hand or to show how it is present-at-hand, but to
point out why Dasein, as Being-in-the-world, has the tendency to bury
the ‘external world’ in nullity ‘epistemologically’ before going on to
prove it. The reason for this lies in Dasein’s falling and in the way in
which the primary understanding of Being has been diverted to Being as
presence-at-hand—a diversion which is motivated by that falling
itself.”—Heidegger, op. cit. p. 250.<a href="#fnref23"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn24"><p>“Behaviour is thus hidden by the reflex, the
elaboration and patterning of stimuli, by a longitudinal theory of
nervous functioning, which establishes a theoretical correspondence
between each element of the situation and an element of the
reaction…”The traditional notion of sensation was not a concept born of
reflection, but a late product of thought directed towards objects, the
last element in the representation of the world, the furthest removed
from its original source, and therefore the most unclear. Inevitably
science, in its general effort towards objectification, evolved a
picture of the human organism as a physical system undergoing stimuli
which were themselves identified by their physico-chemical properties,
and tried to reconstitute actual perception on this basis, and to close
the circle of scientific knowledge by discovering the laws governing the
production of knowledge itself, by establishing an objective science of
subjectivity…“—Merleau-Ponty, op. cit. pp. 8, &amp; 12.<a

<li id="fn27"><p>A reader might notice here the discrepancy between what
I’ve just said and the views one can find in Heidegger’s or Sartre’s
works. These philosophers maintain the notion (in different degrees) of
the separation between my being, i. e. the ‘I’, and being of things, the
objects of the experience which ‘I’ encounters. For example Sartre
developed a fundamental division of being-in-itself and
being-for-itself, which he then tried, and consequently failed, to
reconcile in Being and Nothingess. In-itself is not more real than
for-itself, (i. e. ‘me’ or ‘[my] consciousness’), and the reverse is
also true; in order for it to exist it requires for-itself, as much as
for-itself requires the in-itself. And it is not possible, in good
faith, to think of or regard the in-itself independently of
consciousness, nor consciousness independently of the in-itself, not
even in one’s imagination. ‘Matter’, rūpa, needs consciousness in order
to find its footing in appearance, without it, it is inconceivable. (Cf.
the mutually dependent relationship between nāmarūpa and viññāṇa.) In
brief: whenever there are things, there is me; whenever there is me,
there are things. (Hence one has to understand sabbe dhamma anatta—all
things are not-self.) Whether it is ‘being’ of things that we are
looking at, or my ‘being’, the point is that there is ‘being’—bhava is
there. This is also why, the reader will notice I use ‘existence’ and
‘being’ interchangeably. Whether it is ‘mine’, or not, whether it is
personal or impersonal, large or small, visible or invisible, far or
near, any ‘being’ whatsoever means that bhava is there; it is, it
exists. As long as that is the case, ‘I’ (or at least some degree of the
conceit ‘I am’) will be present.<a href="#fnref27" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn31"><p>Sartre (op. cit. , p. 6) seems to have become aware of
this, but then chose to disagree: “What determines the being of the
appearance is the fact that it appears. And since we have restricted
reality to the phenomenon, we can say of the phenomenon that it is as it
appears. Why not push the idea to its limit and say that the being of
the appearance is its appearing? This is simply a way of choosing new
words to clothe the old”Esse est percipi”of Berkeley… It seems that the
famous formula of Berkeley cannot satisfy us—for two essential reasons,
one concerning the nature of percipi, the other that of the percipere.”
Sartre then goes on to construe consciousness into a form of an ‘empty’
absolute which is “pure ‘appearance’ in the sense that it exists only to
the degree to which appears.” (op. cit., p. 12). There is no question of
things existing to the degree they appear, however there is no such
thing as ‘pure appearance’ in the sense of appearance independent of
that which has appeared, since every appearance has to be appearance of
something. Even if someone says: “Pure appearance”—that designation of
that “pure appearance” is that which stands for that which is “pure
appearance”, thus that “pure appearance” is not pure—Sartre’s “empty
absolute” is thus contradictio in terminis.<a href="#fnref31"

the p. 38 of the same work:”The Dhamma gives the puthujjana the outside
view of avijjā, which is inherently unobtainable for him by unaided

<li id="fn35"><p>Upādāna is defined by the PTS Pali-English Dictionary
as follows: 1) lit. substratum by means of which an active process is
kept alive or going; fuel, supply, provision… 2) ‘drawing upon’,
grasping, taking up…; Assumption, assuming according to Chambers Concise
Dictionary means: to adopt, to take in, to take upon oneself, to take
for granted; [Latin term is assūměre, assumptum: (ad) to (sūměre) take].
The nature of the assumption in general, can be described as follows:
the assumption takes its object for granted, and it does so without
having a knowledge of whether that thing which is being ‘taken up’
actually is in the way that it is taken up. As a matter of fact, not
having a knowledge of this is the fundamental prerequisite for the
assumption to manifest, because if the object is known for what it is,
there wouldn’t be a need to assume it for what it is. Knowledge and
assumption (vijjā and upādāna) are mutually exclusive. However, upādāna
is there (as pañc’upādānakkhandā) which means that the assumption of
what the five aggregates are, preceeds that which five aggregates are.
In this way the beginingless avijjā puts the assumption first, as
something “in front”, something more fundamental, that the five
aggregates which are taken up. This is done in direct violation of the
fact that upādāna cannot be anywhere apart from the five aggregates,
that it actually requires them for its existence. Thus, assumption
assumes priority over that which is already there. That ‘assumed
assumption’ (or taking for granted that which is taken for granted)
becomes the puthujjana’s ‘norm’ of things’ existence, it ‘measures’ them
according what it thinks they are, not for what they are. The extent of
the assumption determines the extent of this measure (i. e. the
existence)— upādānapaccāya bhavo. (Cf. Sartre, op. cit., p. 2: “…then
the appearance becomes full positivity; its essence is an ‘appearing’
which is no longer opposed to being but on the contrary is the measure
of it.”)<a href="#fnref35" class="footnote-back"

prefer ‘infinite’ so that the distinction between the inherent nature of

as it would ‘a percept is felt’ (which mix up saññā and vedanā); but it
is quite in order to say ‘a feeling, a percept, (that is, a felt thing,
a perceived thing) is cognized’, which simply means that a feeling or a
percept is present (as, indeed, they both are in all experience—see
Majjhima v,3 (M.i,293)). Strictly speaking, then, what is cognized is
nāmarūpa, whereas what is perceived (or felt) is saññā (or vedanā),
i.e. only nāma. This distinction can be shown grammatically. Vijānāti,
to cognize, is active voice in sense (taking an objective accusative):
consciousness cognizes a phenomenon (nāmarūpa); consciousness is always
consciousness of something. Sañjānāti, to perceive, (or vediyati, to
feel) is middle voice in sense (taking a cognate accusative): perception
perceives [a percept] (or feeling feels [a feeling]). Thus we should say
‘a blue thing (= a blueness), a painful thing (= a pain), is cognized’,
but ‘blue is perceived’ and ‘pain is felt’. (In the Suttas generally,
due allowance is to be made for the elasticity in the common usage of
words. But in certain passages, and also in one’s finer thinking,

repetitive style which aligns things in the order they are to be
understood (which is also the reason why the Suttas are in that form).
Also, refraining from a too particular and established terminology was
intentional, since that would most likely lead a reader to assume that
he already knows what those terms refer to.<a href="#fnref99"

or neither, in regard to that because of which intentions are there,
that because of which intentions are there remains there, regardless of
the intention in regard to it. By understanding that it is fundamentally
inaccessible to one’s intentions, one ceases to crave towards it with
those intentions, one ceases to assume it through those intentions,
since neither intentions nor that which directly stands upon them,
namely-one’s assumption-could access it. And one knows that. [‘Ignorant
intentions’ are simply craving, which leads to ‘assumption’-taṇhapaccayā

<li id="fn108"><p>If one thinks “there is that because of which
intentions are there, which is inaccessible to those intentions”, that
thought ‘stands for’ that because of which intentions are there, and
through that thought one assumes access to that
inaccessible-inaccessible exists. If one knows that regardless of what a
thought or intention stand for, it can never “step outside” of its
nature-one can only think one’s thoughts (perception perceived) or
intend one’s intentions, not that because of which that
thought/intention are there-one ceases to assume that which that
intention stands for, because of which intention is there. Thus,
intention remains, while “attempts to access” fade away, since one sees
them as pointless and loses interest in them. When those “attempts” are
thoroughly subdued, ‘the assumption’ of that which was assumed
“accessible” (through those very attempts) disappears too, never to
return.<a href="#fnref108" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn109"><p>The only reason why assumption can be made redundant,
is because it was redundant in the first place. Not knowing that it was
redundant, makes it necessary, until it ceases to be so. And the reason
why assumption presents itself as necessary is because it assumes that
which is necessary in one’s experience, namely-the five aggregates.
Thus, the five aggregates, which are necessary in one’s experience, come
to exist, through the assuming of them as that which is necessary in
one’s experience. But since they are necessary in one’s experience,
assuming them as necessary in one’s experience is not necessary. But
until one knows that, that assumption will exist.<a href="#fnref109"

practice he has chosen or been given is inherently wrong, no right
results can come from it. One does not accidentally become sotāpanna, it
doesn’t “happen to one” as a blessing. One builds it up, develops it and
attains it through “manly efforts,” as the Suttas often say, and because
it was not given to one, it cannot be taken away.<a href="#fnref119"

<li id="fn127"><p>In other words, it is impossible to perform an action
which in and by itself would be able to overcome the nature of action,
which is the whole point of the Buddhist practice: overcoming kamma.
Through action, good or bad or neutral, all one accomplishes is the
maintenance of the nature of action: by acting, one remains bound by
action. If this would not be the case, the Buddha and the Dhamma would
not be required for the freedom from suffering, and all one would have
to do is simply perform certain things and by doing so, automatically
reach nibbāna, or even better: all one would have to do is choose to be
in nibbāna and one would attain it.<a href="#fnref127"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn128"><p>And one also comes to realize that for as long as one
is alive, experience is always there, and one doesn’t have to do
anything in order for it to be so. And this is where the real purpose of
a meditation technique becomes apparent: one is after a particular type
of experience (regarded as more desirable and lofty) as a form of
replacement or escape from another type of experience (regarded as
undesirable and unpleasant). “I want to experience this, I don’t want to
experience that (or lack-of-this). Thus, all one is trying to do is
experience pleasant by directly displacing unpleasant, i.e. one wants to
fulfill one’s immediate desire. For as long as one remains concerned and
puts value on the particulars of an experience, the nature of it will
remain unknown. This is the reason why any meditation of this kind is a
meditation that is utterly within the sensual domain and cannot go
beyond it, which is what MN 108 (iii, 14) refers to.<a href="#fnref128"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn129"><p>People themselves might often struggle to reconcile
the nature of meditation techniques with the nature of the Buddha’s
Teaching, but they usually end up ignoring this because it feels like
the immediate application of a technique is helping them and makes them
feel better. The problem with this is that they, as puthujjanas, have no
criteria to determine what “helpful” really is. Thus, they just end up
following their own feelings and assumptions again, but this time on the
pretext of Buddhism and spiritual practice.<a href="#fnref129"

only because that nature is there, present.<a href="#fnref130"

<li id="fn131"><p>Cf. my essay Not Perceiving the Feeling (Meanings,

<li id="fn132"><p>This is a type of structural indifference and this can
be understood in terms of the superimposition of the respective domains
of body (matter) and thoughts. Both of these domains are simultaneously
present, but they don’t interfere – they are “indifferent” to each
other. Furthermore, it is not just that they don’t interfere, it is that
they cannot interfere, even if one is to want it. This principle
actually applies to the whole experience, namely: the five aggregates.
Crossing from one domain into another is structurally inconceivable, but
as long as one does not fully understand that, by not-understanding one
conceives it. For more on this cf. my essays The Infinity of the Mind
and Not Perceiving the Feeling (Meanings, p. 39 and p.43).<a

results in higher establishments of mind (<em>samadhi</em>). For
example, this is where mind surmounts the fundamental “generality” of
form, by the way of surmounting the generality of earth, water, fire and
