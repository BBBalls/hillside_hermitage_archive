**Ajahn Nyanamoli**: What is the result of a successful practice?

**Q**: Not being bothered as much.

**Nm**: In that case, what can happen is that when people get inspired
to practice, they end up constructing an environment around them whereby
nothing bothers them; where everything is at arm’s length; and it feels
like their practice is succeeding because they don’t suffer as much
factually. They end up measuring their success by how much better they
can manage their suffering. Which, suffice to say, is quite unfortunate.

How would you know that you are practicing correctly? How is not being
bothered practically measured in terms of the insight talked about in
the suttas?

**Q**: What about if your mind moves less on account of the thought of
dying?

**Nm**: What do the suttas define as the culminating insight required
for a mind to not move on account of dying?

**Q**: Anicca.

**Nm**: What’s the insight that anicca and dukkha culminate in?

**Q**: Anatta.

**Nm**: Exactly, that is the culminating insight. The complete
cessation, first of self-view, then of conceit. And when that is
completely gone without any trace—you couldn’t suffer even if you want
to.

**Q**: Is the measure that the less somebody takes things personally,
the more they are progressing in the practice?

**Nm**: It could be. But you also have psycho-therapeutical methods that
teach you how ‘not to take things personally’. But you’re taking *that*
personally. So, it has to be an actual insight into anatta. And anatta
is not something you can stumble upon accidentally. That’s why you need
the voice of another and yoniso manasikara (concurrent attention) based
on sense restraint. It’s a factual, irreversible insight. Seeing anicca
and dukkha is just so that you can experience the anatta.

**Q**: You can say my mind won’t be bothered by even the thought of
dying. But anatta is more fundamental than becoming so mentally strong
that nothing bothers you.

**Nm**: Yes. That’s a necessary prerequisite for insight. As the Buddha
said during his life, some teachers could help one establish
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, which means you are pretty much
unbothered by anything inferior to that. But only in the dispensation of
the Buddha could one attain the anatta part. The suttas say that an
Arahant’s mind doesn’t get overwhelmed by things—an Arahant’s mind
overwhelms things. That is the factual strength, without which one
couldn’t understand and fully develop the anatta.

<div lang="en">

But say you have been sense restrained, seeing the danger in the
slightest fault, guarding the sense doors, keeping the precepts, living
in solitude. If you are meeting the requirements to start seeing and
abandoning attavada(self-view),… what then is self-view? Is it something
that would occur, and you can interpret it in hindsight? Or do you need
to know where to look for it, to see it and recognize it? What’s the
necessary basis for anatta?

**Q**: Seeing atta (self).

**Nm**: Yes. What is atta then?

**Q**: You can’t put it in front of you—it’s always peripheral.

**Nm**: Yes, the properties of atta—the sense of self—are that it’s not
directly visible. You can’t access it through your senses. You can’t
observe it with your five senses, and you can’t say ‘this is my “Self”
that I am relating to’. It’s always ambiguous. What else? Do you have
the experience of when that self is not there?

**Q**: No.

**Nm**: It’s always there to some degree. Sometimes it might feel
clearer or more ambiguous. But that sense of self—the center of
experience—is always there. Do you see it right now as we speak—the
sense of self enduring on its own—somehow ambiguously lingering?

**Q**: To some degree. Accepting its allusivity is important when it
comes to seeing it on its own terms.

**Nm**: That’s the key there. The way to see it is on its own terms.
That is what solitude and the practice of mindfulness are. Not how to
make it into an object of observation that I think it should be.

<u>**The Present Memory**</u>

Mindfulness is the memory of your present experience. By abandoning the
views of mindfulness being concentration on the present moment you
realize that there’s nothing complicated about it. Having the memory of
the present moment while we speak—that’s what mindfulness is. The
practice of memory here and now.

It’s like a different angle of attending to what is directly attended in
front of me—yoniso manasikara. If I ask you to recall a memory, how
would you do that? Focus on sensations and your breathing? No, it would
be the opposite. You would de-focus on what you were focusing on, to
recall or recollect what is there.

That point of view—of memory—whether it’s the memory of this second or
the memory of 10 years ago, is the same point of view. It’s the point of
view that you can use to observe the present experience; at the same
time, you are (indirectly) in the present experience. It’s the
background of your current absorbed attention. It’s the ‘point of view’
of your senses. It’s where the mind is.

That ambiguous ‘sense of self’ is neither here (in the senses) nor there
(in the sense objects); it’s in between the two.

If you’re of the view that that sense of self is something you can think
directly, or that it’s something you can access through your senses
directly, or that it’s something you can observe and see as ‘anatta’;
you are not seeing anatta. You are just chasing the idea that you have
intellectually developed—on account of reading the suttas or listening
to talks. The sense of self is always behind from where you are looking.
When you realize that the range of where you can look is either the
direction of where you attend or the direction of the memory point of
view; you realize that you don’t need to know specifically where the
sense of self is. You know that it will have to be between the two
points of view—that are there at the same time running concurrently.

“With this, this is”. It’s not that the memory point of view (where the
mind is) comes first, in the sense that it exists apart from the senses.
No, they exist simultaneously. One is the way of direct attention, and
the other is the knowledge of direct attention (yoniso manasikara).
That’s why sati and memory are used interchangeably in the suttas. The
problem is that when one hears the word ‘memory’ one can have the view
of the past. But, even if it’s the past, it’s presently recollected.
Then you realize that you could practice, instead of only recollecting
the past; recollect what is presently enduring. Not allowing myself to
directly attend to it but knowing it on the level of memory.

Are you seated now? Yes. That’s a present memory. You don’t need to feel
your knees. The recognition of that simultaneously enduring point of
view is there. It’s two points of observance of the same thing. Because
they are *two* points of view (not one), neither can be in charge or
master of the experience. With this, this is. Without this, this
wouldn’t be. Either way, there’s no room for ownership.

Let’s say you start practicing sati correctly in solitude. You are
recollecting what you are presently doing instead of being absorbed into
attending to what you are presently doing. Keeping that peripheral point
of view. Watching what is present—sitting, breathing, etc… The memory of
current breathing is what anapanasati is. It’s not the accessing of it
through directly attending the sensations of it, but accessing it
through the indirect knowledge (point of view) of it. The recognition of
the images of breathing that you are doing. That’s what memory is.

The atta (sense of self)—however ambiguous, fleeting, or unclear it
might be—it’s real as such. Instead of you trying to ‘see myself on the
level of directly attended experience’, you see it for whatever it
is—however it is: A thick cloud; sometimes palpable; sometimes not… But
the sense of self, the sense of ‘I am’ is there, lingering. In other
words, you can’t go behind it. You can’t become the observer of it and
turn it into an object. It’s always in the background.

How do you make it not perpetually escape you?

**Q**: It will always be allusive.

**Nm**: Everybody can recognize its ambiguity, but then they feel a
pressure, impulse, or tendency to try and clarify it. They think that
the only way they can relate to it is if it is more defined. But it’s
not. It’s an ambiguous phenomenon. It’s neither here nor there, but it
is real as such. That’s why you shouldn’t dismiss it, redefine it, or
mystify it; it’s a real phenomenon like any other thing. If you try to
directly access it, it’s always going to slip through your fingers.

So first you realize that you cannot make it *not* allusive. It’s going
to stay allusive. You need to accept the ambiguity of it, as its
characteristic. That’s enough for you to recognize it as being there.

How do you access it without grabbing it?

**Q**: By recollecting it.

**Nm**: By surmounting it in the sense that we just described. There is
an ambiguous thing that’s neither in my senses nor away from it. It’s
kind of always there. But wherever it is, it *must* be in between this
and this: What I am directly attending, and the knowledge of what I am
directly attending. It cannot be outside of these two directions.
Recollect that frequently and in solitude—based on your currently
enduring sense of self (not just theoretically). This sense of self that
you’re not trying to define, or ignore, has to be in between ‘this and
this’ (the two simultaneous points of view).

Becoming established in that idea is how you uproot the sense of self.
You don’t uproot it immediately. You uproot the view that the sense of
self can be outside ‘this, and this’; outside of the experience as a
whole; outside of the five aggregates—whichever way you want to define
it.

If I look in the direction of what I am attending, or in the direction
of memory; those are the two ends. Nothing can be outside of these.
Although this sense of self feels inaccessible directly, it’s always
there, and none of this pertains to it; it has to be within this. It
cannot be outside of it because all I have is ‘this, and this’. Even the
thought ‘outside’ of this experience, and the external world; is within
‘this, and this’; within the attending it and having the memory of it.

<u>**Two Directions, two points of view - concurrent attention.**</u>

**Q**: That’s all that appears—‘with this, this is’.

**Nm**: And a lot more appears in between—but not outside of it. When I
say ‘in between’, I don’t mean in a third place between the two. I mean,
based on these two simultaneous directions. That’s why the Buddha
described Namarupa Vinnana, Vinnana Namarupa. They mutually determine
each other. Neither comes before the other. They are two sheaves of
reeds leaning on each other equally. They cannot remain standing if one
is removed.

</div>

**Q**: It might be useful to mention two common wrong views to
illustrate what you mean by these two directions, for example,
empiricism and idealism.

**Nm**: Both imply that one direction comes first. Materialism,
empiricism, and the scientific view are based on the assumption that
‘what is attended to \[through the senses\]’ comes first. Then you can
have solipsism, idealism, or all sorts of variations that are based on
the assumption that ‘the mind’ comes first. The Buddha discovered that
they are simultaneous to the same extent. That is paticcasamuppada in a
nutshell: ‘With this, this is’; ‘Without this, this wouldn’t be’. That’s
it.

The Arahant does not destroy these two things to become an Arhant. He
just removes any traces of ignorance regarding it. Practically (as
opposed to theoretically), there is what you are currently attending to,
for example, ‘the seated body here and now’; and ‘the thought about the
seated body here and now’. I can have a memory of that ‘here and now’, I
can have a memory of what that ‘here and now’ was yesterday, two, days
ago, etc… And by withdrawing and expanding my mind from the senses, I
could have a memory past this life. The point is, it’s still within the
same two points of view that are simultaneously present.

These two points of view are all you ever have, it’s just that there are
wrong views about what comes first; and everything else in between. That
generally results in the weight of this experience being put on the
sense of self as the owner—outside of this: The sense of self can
remember, the sense of self can attend, the sense of self can do both,
and look in between. But then you realize that that sense of self, as
ambiguous as it is, is still an arisen phenomenon that you can have a
memory of. It’s actually an object. Not an object that you can direct
your attention to, but in its own regard, it’s a thing as such that
exists in your mind. Thus, you are not it.

Now you can *say* there’s no sense of self, but there is a sense of
self. You just need to stop putting it first. Find that upon which it
depends. And see your experience as fundamentally determined
simultaneously by two points of view at once: One of memory, and one of
direct attention. It means neither of them can be the center or master
of the experience. When there are two, there cannot be one owner. Any
notion of the external world, any notion of scientific observation; has
to be within these two points of view. Any notion of a solipsistic world
where ‘I’ is first; has to be within these two points of
view—<span lang="pi">Paticcasamuppada</span>.

Often, when people asked the Buddha about the sense of self; saying that
‘Master Gotama says there is no self \[implying that non-self is a
self\]’ or any other mysticism; he would just be silent. However, on
some other occasions, people did ask him the same question and he
replied—but not to their question. He would say ‘with this, this is’,
‘with Vinnana, Namarupa; with Namarupa, Vinnana’. Why would he give that
answer to ‘where is my sense of self?’. Then you realize that it’s
because that is where the sense of self is.

Fully understanding ‘with this, this is’. Understanding that there is no
‘outside’ of these two directions. There is then the abandoning of the
sense of self when you see that it is always undermined by the other
direction. That’s the most direct answer for how to develop ‘not self’.

The Buddha could describe ‘with this, this is’ (paticcasamuppada) in
many different subtle details. But fundamentally, all you need to
contemplate is the principle ‘with this, this is’ on the right level.

With what, what is? With this—that which I’m directly attending to (my
experience as a whole); and with this—the image of the experience as a
whole—the memory of it simultaneously present. If that image-memory was
not there, you wouldn’t know the experience as a whole, as the
experience you are attending to. These two points of view are
simultaneous/concurrent: One feeds the other, one defines the other. If
there are no senses that are attending and operating in their own
domain, there would be nothing to have an image of. If there is no
image, recollection, or memory of the senses and the world that the
senses are in; nothing would be intelligible. You would not be a
conscious being.

So what then is the practice?

Whatever happens throughout the day—make sure that you don’t forget the
context of ‘with this, this is’.

Whether you’re recollecting birth or death, or Namarupa Vinnana; the
principle of ‘with this, this is’; the principle of two simultaneously
present things and everything else in between; always remains the same.
The monk who establishes that rightly, doesn’t take ‘I’ to be first (to
be his own), or forms in the world, or mental objects. Everything else
in between—the feelings arising on account of perceptions, and all of
the other experiences in between this relationship—he then equally won’t
take as his.

If you make the effort to not ignore this right order, then whatever
you’re experiencing—based on sense restraint, virtue and solitude, you
include in the order ‘with this, this is’—there is no outside of it. It
doesn’t matter if it’s more on the mental memory side or more on the
palpable side; that’s why we keep saying the content doesn’t matter. The
nature of things matters. It’s present as such. Whichever way it feels,
it’s got to be felt within ‘with this, this is’—not outside of it.

And when I think ‘outside of it’, that’s within the enduring body here,
and the memory of the enduring body here. It’s still enclosed within the
same principle. The moment you hammer that in, whereby you cannot forget
that there is no outside of ‘with this, this is’—that’s where your
attavada is gone. You continue to operate externally. You might still
look the same. But your assumption of external to ‘with this, this is’
is now inconceivable—because it is inconceivable. ‘Conceiving’ is seen
within it. Because you have developed the perspective of ‘with this,
this is’ sufficiently enough to include the wildest of your careless
fantasies, imaginations, assumptions… It’s still seen rightly, as
second—within it.

Now if you sustain, invest effort, purify, establish, and endure that
view; there will be no room for the slightest traces of conceit to
remain. You might have abandoned the view of the external entity of ‘me’
existing independent of it, but there will still be subtler habits,
leanings, and cravings implying independence (between ‘this’ and
‘this’). You might think ‘it’s still within “this and this” but it’s a
bit independent’. Then you realize even *that* cannot stand outside
these two directions. If the principle of paticcasamuppada is thoroughly
developed, dhamma is fulfilled. That’s why the suttas say ‘one who sees
paticcasamuppada, sees the dhamma’. There’s no delay there. It’s the
right view that, if you cultivate it, can only result in the direct
purification of your being. Removal and cessation of passion, greed,
aversion, and delusion. Because all of those things imply a degree of
that conceit, self-centeredness, and craving. But none of that can stand
if this right view is hammered in.

<u>**Beyond right view**</u>

**Q**: Could it be correct to say that the removal of attavada is to see
that view of paticcasamuppada rightly—as you described? And then you
don’t need the view anymore. You can’t even have that pure view anymore
if that conceit is removed because you would *be* it. In the sense that
paticcasamuppada is what you are.

**Nm**: Yes. For an Arahant, because there are no more traces of conceit
left, he doesn’t need to recollect and re-establish that view—because
there’s nothing perverting it. The suttas say that ‘the Arahant has gone
beyond the view’. Which means, even the right view is gone. He doesn’t
have it anymore because he has no wrong reference regarding it
anymore—to define it.

**Q**: Whereas someone who sees that has another reference point.

**Nm**: And he can fall back onto the fetters that he hasn’t abandoned.
He can’t fall back beyond that. So a sotapanna can abandon his training,
become careless, and not invest more effort into sustaining and
purifying this view that he has; but he cannot spill outside with his
assumptions of attavada, the external ‘self’, or the ‘over there’.
That’s inconceivable because, even when the mind has those thoughts,
they’re seen in the background of the memory of ‘with this, this is’.

**Q**: And that’s effortless. It’s just seen like that. It cannot not be
seen like that.

**Nm**: Exactly. The effort is on the level of acting out of the habits,
pressures, and passions. Including trying to get rid of it directly,
through all sorts of practices. That’s the effort. But the view in
itself requires no effort.

**Q**: Because it’s not like a view that you hold.

**Nm**: Well, in a way, any view is effortless. Worldly views are
effortless. That’s why they’re so hard to uproot. You don’t even see how
you’re doing them, because you’re not doing them directly.

**Q**: So, whether it’s effortless or not, is not what makes the
difference.

**Nm**: What makes the difference is whether it’s right or wrong.
Whether it’s contradicting the order of things, the arrangement of the
aggregates, the experience as a whole, etc… or not. Whether it’s aligned
with the order of things, the arrangement of the aggregates, etc. That’s
why the term ‘dhamma’ is used interchangeably as phenomena and the
knowledge of ‘the way out’.

**Q**: It’s still a phenomenon in both cases.

**Nm**: It’s a phenomenon, yes. It’s just rightly established, the right
order of phenomena, and the wrong order of phenomena. There is no third
option. If the right order of phenomena is established ‘with this, this
is’, dispassion will have to be an inevitable result. Like the simile of
the river sloping down the mountain—the water has to go that way because
that’s where the mountain slopes. If your slope is established upon the
right order, the mind will have to slope towards nibbana, dispassion,
cooling down, removal of ownership, and any traces of ownership of atta.

The moment you start seeing ‘the self’ (that ambiguous phenomenon we
started describing) as ‘an ambiguous phenomenon that endures there
peripherally’—that’s already the beginning of relinquishing the
ownership of it. That’s why I keep saying that *you* don’t remove the
attavada—you remove the ownership of it. Because it’s neither here nor
there—but it’s known to be between the two. Thus, atta becomes an-atta.
But the thing is there. The creature or individual—whatever you want to
call it—is still there. That ambiguous sense of self of these 5
aggregates, of these memories, future plans, and everything else remains
there; it’s just impossible to own.

**Q**: Perhaps it’s necessary to emphasize that it’s ‘*direction*’; you
can never access an endpoint to the direction.

**Nm**: Even if you’re not necessarily thinking about either direction,
you realize that you are within the two. Your non-thinking, your
distraction, is within ‘with this, this is’. It’s within: What’s
presently attended to, and the memory of it—even if it is presently
unattended to in unawareness.

**Q**: What do you think about defining ‘with this, this is’ in terms of
‘the direction of what is attended to’ and ‘the direction of where
attention is coming from’?

**Nm**: Exactly. That’s what <span lang="pi">*yoniso*</span> is. The
womb of what you’re looking at. They are simultaneously present as ‘with
this, this is’. So what you’re looking at, or touching, etc… it’s there
where that image is. It’s not in you: ‘In me’ it’s ‘there’ where that
image is. So, it’s just outside and more outside (internally speaking).

**Q**: Inaccessible.

**Nm**: Yes, inaccessible. That’s why the description of an Arahant says
‘all that’s left is this conscious body, and name-and-form externally’.
Because he has completely abandoned everything that needed to be
abandoned on account of seeing the principle of ‘with this, this is’.
The more you practice these two internal points of view (attention and
present memory); the more external the whole thing becomes. They are
becoming two external points of view, and thus there is nothing ‘in me’.

The image ‘in me’ is already external to my own sense of self. The sense
of self is external to itself thus it’s not mine. That’s why it’s a bit
ambiguous in the suttas between the usage of ‘internal’ and ‘external’.
Sometimes ‘internal’ basically stands for ‘mine’—because that’s where
‘mine’ is. Here, you will start internally, stop assuming the external
world, and in the end; that ‘internal’ non-assumption of the external
world is seen as a thing ‘out there’—with purification from attavada.
That’s like the body there ‘to the extent necessary’. The image of the
body, the memory of the body there, understood as ‘body there’, to the
extent necessary for the final knowledge and the final uprooting of
passion.

There’s nothing mystical about it. You can have a memory from ten years
ago, ten days ago, or you can have a memory of what you’re doing right
now. The image of it is the memory of it. Simultaneously present,
enduring, giving the context to what you’re attending. But you need to
stop putting yourself first, as the one who remembers, and start seeing
yourself as an enduring thing: within that memory, and the world that is
directly attended to (the senses and the objects of your attention).

The mind and the five senses; *that’s* the experience as a whole. ‘With
this, this is’, and any notion of self, ownership, consciousness,
feelings, decisions, past and future plans, griefs, joys… it’s all
within these two, utterly inaccessible directions. They are just two
sheaves of reeds holding each other. Everything dear to me or not dear
to me is just gratuitously sitting there on top of these, i.e., it
cannot be mine.

<u>**Remembering the right order**</u>

The practice of sati is the practice of memory, for example, of your
present body posture. *Memory*—not direct attention. Have a memory of
your presently enduring body posture. Have a memory of your presently
enduring feeling. Have a memory of your presently enduring thoughts.
Again, the memory of it. So emphasize the memory point of view, not the
directly attending point of view. That’s how the signs of the mind will
become apparent. That’s how the shape of the ambiguous state of mind and
sense of self is going to be discerned.

**Q**: That memory is uprooting atta. In the sense that no matter what
choices ‘I’ make, ‘I’ have to be within ‘with this, this is’.

**Nm**: Exactly. It resets the right order. Then when you inevitably
have the thought that took you away from the principle of ‘with this,
this is’, you don’t negate it, or try to get rid of it, stop thinking,
focus… No, you have a memory of having it right here and now—because it
is here and now. You do that long enough and the fact that it’s
inconceivable for it to be outside of ‘with this, this is’, will become
established. There is no going back from there.

Even if you then stop recollecting the two directions, a sotapanna’s
knowledge cannot be undone—that it cannot be outside of these
directions. I can ignore this knowledge because I’m too occupied with
the world or family. It doesn’t matter—the knowledge that it cannot be
outside of ‘with this, this is’ is still there. The gratuitous
assumption of a self, living there independently (an owner)—and the
entire mass of suffering that is dependent on that deeply rooted
perversion—is gone. That’s why there is no ‘second arrow’ hitting an
Ariya Savaka as the suttas describe. Because that deeply perverted
order, that projected you out there into even worse circumstances than
you already are in, is gone.

Craving is bad, the conceit is bad but not as bad as the wrong view of
attavada. Not as bad as the level of perversion that ignores ‘with this,
this is’. The more you pervert this order, the more you own the self.
Which means, the heavier it is. Which means, losing it is going to be
far worse. Somebody with only traces of conceit; if they were to lose
their life, health, or things that were dear to them; won’t suffer. As a
sotapanna, you would have seven grains of sand of suffering left, in
comparison to the Himalayas that were destroyed by getting the right
view and ceasing to assume outside of yourself.

**Q**: Because you know the escape.

**Nm**: Yes, and factually the burden—to a great degree—has been made
inconceivable. That’s also why the right view (freeing yourself of the
assumption of self) surpasses all assumptions (upadanas). Because
attavada is on the level of ‘with this, this is’. The upadana (or
assumption) of ‘virtue and duty’ (silabatta parāmāsa), sensuality
(kama), and all of the other wrong views, are not on the level of ‘with
this, this is’. All views are contained within ‘with this, this is’.
Somebody who has understood it is a sotapanna—is free from attavada—even
though they might not be free from sensuality, ill will, and all of the
other things that are in between.

<u>**The Earth element**</u>

**Q**: Can we explore this [discourse](https://suttacentral.net/mn62)
where the Buddha talks to Rahula about these five elements? He starts
talking first about the earth element; then he mentions hair of the
head, hair of the body, skin, teeth… Then he says, ‘that which is
internally clung to or held as mine’ is undermined by the fact that
‘internal earth element’ and ‘external earth element’ both are earth
element. Can we also contemplate that sutta by discerning that you
cannot just have internal earth element, you cannot just have external
earth element: You need to have both, for any of this to be—for all
elements.

**Nm**: Yes. And that could also stand for the principle of ‘with this,
this is’. It’s not on the level of directly attending to earth and
staring at a piece of soil. It’s recollecting the great earth. Have a
memory of what you are already in: ‘Be like earth’—recall the properties
of the earth that’s currently enduring.

Earth is not elsewhere while we talk and forget about it. You are on
earth. Factually it’s there, it endures as the basis for your
experience. What are the properties of that ‘external’ earth? Can this
‘internal’ earth that I’m paired with control any properties outside the
properties of the earth—that are different from it? That would not be
affected if the great earth is affected? That’s inconceivable.

Sustain that image; ‘with this, this is’—there will be no room for the
ownership to remain there clinging to this part or that part. You won’t
be able to assume ‘I’m not this body but I am the universe’. Which
universe? The one that changes against your will all the
time—forcefully, violently, disrupts, erupts, gets destroyed? Look at
those mountains—they come to destruction eventually. What is to be said
of this tiny fickle body, in relation to the size of them—that’s equally
unpredictable? ‘With this, this is’. The properties of this, cannot not
be the properties of this inferior thing. That’s the practice of kasinas
in a nutshell. The elements of earth, fire, water, air, space,
consciousness…

The Buddha would describe a Brahmin establishing his mind on the level
of that great earth. Anything inferior to that cannot perturb him. If
you’re always thinking about the presently enduring earth, while you’re
here on it, you’ll probably develop the contemporary
*eco-anxiety*—worrying about what will happen to the earth. Even if it’s
not ecology related, you’re going to have anxiety if you’re not
relinquishing your sense of self. If you don’t know what comes first and
what to look for. Because you realize that all of your life’s concerns,
joys, possessions, future, past… presuppose this enduring planet of
earth. You are bound with this great lump of soil that is simultaneously
present; as an uncontrollable, unownable basis for experience. Now, if
your mind is established on that level, i.e. it has relinquished the
ownership of everything inferior to the earth; any changes inferior to
the earth changing could not bother you.

However, those Brahmins that could factually establish their minds in
the right order, on the right level, and to the right extent; did not
know the gratification, danger, and escape regarding that great earth.
The Tathāgata knows it, and that’s why he’s free in both regards. Those
Brahmins, outside of the Buddha’s dispensation, who developed the mind
on the level of the earth, had to some extent put it first. They did not
see ‘with this, this is’: They did not see that their memory, knowledge,
image, or recollection of the earth; wouldn’t be possible if it weren’t
for ‘this, here immediate earth’. They went too far this side or too far
on the other side. They saw a certain relationship of surmounting, but
they didn’t see that that great earth is defined, as such, on account of
this little body. That’s why the entire universe is within this body.
That is the measure of the universe, and the universe then defines this
body. So ‘with this, this is’.

The same goes for somebody concerned with this inferior earth as an
internal ‘me’, or ‘my body’. You can cultivate and apply the properties
of that great earth to it; that is unbothered by people throwing stuff
on it, digging it, and destroying it. These things make no difference to
the great earth. Apply those same properties to this internal
body—because it is the same element—and you will see that it’s your
ownership that created that gratuitous division of ‘mine’; ‘internal’
and ‘external’ etc…
