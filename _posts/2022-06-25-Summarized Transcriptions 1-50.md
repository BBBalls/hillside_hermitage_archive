## 05hh- Purpose Of The Precepts

**Q:** What is the purpose of the precepts?

**Nm:** The purpose is for developing strength of mind and the first
step for achieving that is to be able to say "no" to yourself. To say
"no" to your desires, whims, habits and addictions. The main rules on
which the practice is based are very practical and necessary. They are
not supposed to be held because of a belief or because an authority
tells you to, they are kept because they hold, in themselves, the
practice of meditation - the development of mind. Think of the precepts
as a fertile ground where you can plant seeds in order to grow fruit
trees. They are not the tree or the seed, but having a grown tree would
be impossible without that fertile ground existing. In that sense, you
can see the necessity of the fertile ground being present, you can see
the necessity of the precepts. Without them, there is no point in you
watering seeds, when you have destroyed the fertility of the ground,
when you have compromised the fundamental precepts.

**Q:** What are you trying to grow?

**Nm:** You are trying to grow your freedom of mind because it is bound
by craving, it is liable to feelings. Which means when pain arises you
won\'t be able to not resist it, when pleasure arises you won\'t be able
but to indulge it. In other words, you are controlled by what you feel
and you are controlled because the mind is too weak in regard to what it
feels. So if you want to become stronger than all of those things, then
the first step to develop that strength is restraint, the ability to say
"no", not to everything forever, but to certain things which are
unwholesome.

**Q:** Could you explain the precept in regard to eating?

**Nm:** You eat because it is necessary for the body to live, and not
for sensual reasons or escape from boredom, i.e. eating whatever and
whenever. You should recognise the necessity of eating and that\'s what
you keep in mind, if you eat enough calories once a day, that is
sufficient, there is no good reason to eat more. Eating more than you
need is a form of sensuality, it comes from craving.

**Q:** But in the evening you could suffer from hunger.

**Nm:** It\'s not a life threatening hunger. In the evening, if you have
eaten enough calories in the morning, you have the desire to eat and
instead of habitually just giving in to desire and trying to satisfy it
by any means, you instead force yourself to restrain and reflect on it:
"Ok, why am I pulled by this desire, why is this hunger controlling my
mind? Am I really hungry or am I just bored? Does the sensation of an
empty stomach mean that I have to eat?". Through correct contemplation
and restraint you will get to understand where the problem is.

**Q:** If I eat a meal at night, then I will be free from that desire.

**Nm:** No you won\'t. You will be free from hunger, but hunger was not
your desire. Yes, there would have been no desire without hunger but
hunger is not the desire. Desire is always mental. So when physical
hunger affects and controls your mind, then it becomes a desire, which
means you might go and remove the physical state but the liability of
your mind to be controlled by the physical state remains. Which means
that when the next physical thing comes, you will equally be bound by
the same desire, hence you can\'t satisfy your desire and everybody
knows that. You can be choosing and engaging in all sorts of sensuality,
but you cannot satisfy that desire because it\'s not there where you are
trying to satisfy it. You are appeasing/satisfying physical
circumstances, but those are not what the desire is. Yes, desire is
inseparable from those things but it\'s not those things.

The precepts are basically putting up a boundary fence, making the soil
fertile so that you can practice. All the precepts are quite practical.
In the beginning the monks were allowed to eat in the evening, they
could eat throughout the day but then it became impractical for various
reasons, going out at night, facing all sorts of dangers, etc. So then a
rule was formulated to eat only at the right time, i.e. you don\'t go
out at night to collect food but only in the morning. It became more
practical, and you don\'t spend the rest of your day planning and being
concerned about food, but rather you spend it practising restraint,
composure and wisdom.

The eight precepts is what defines a fertile field that is not
negotiable. For example, how can you possibly be developing clarity and
strength of mind, when you are drinking alcohol that\'s clearly directly
affecting your clarity of mind. You need to eat some food but you don\'t
need to drink alcohol, hence it\'s always going to be done for sensual
reasons. Even when people say that they only drink socially or that
people around them pressure them to do so, that\'s also a sensual
reason, because you are basically afraid of adversely affecting your
sensual environment. You don\'t want to upset anyone or be shunned by
your social group. That\'s quite ridiculous especially if you are trying
to develop the strength of mind. How can that be developed if you give
in to minor weaknesses or are moved because people laugh and tease you
for not drinking. So what? How can you go beyond suffering, when just by
someone teasing you, you cannot maintain your virtuous behaviour.

**Q:** The precepts are not the only work that one must do.

**Nm:** The eight precepts are the necessary fertile field which is the
basis for starting the work. You can have all the fertile ground that
you want but if you don\'t have the correct seeds and if you don\'t put
the work in maintaining the soil, they are not going to grow. The soil
will not do the work for you, it\'s just the soil..

## 10hh- No One Wants Sensuality

**Q:** Bhante, you once said that the only reason one gives into
sensuality is because one doesn\'t want it. What do you mean by that?

**Nm:** Well, what I meant was that universally, literally every human
mind, regardless of the culture, education or religion, when a desire in
regard to anything obtainable through the senses arises, that desire is
oppressing. Desire is a need, a thirst, a hunger, it pressures you to
act. You don\'t have to act and that\'s the whole point. As a human
being you have a choice. But when desire arises, the automatic response
is to give into that pressure of desire, and why would you be giving
into the pressure of any desire? It\'s because it\'s unpleasant. If the
pressure of the desire is neutral or pleasant, you wouldn\'t then make
any effort and spend time trying to gain what your desire wants, because
you\'ll already be at ease. But that desire is already unpleasant and in
order for you to try and deal with that displeasure, you just give in to
whatever the desire promises. That\'s what I mean, by engaging in
sensuality, you do so to be free from the sensual pressure of the
desire. When people say, "No, I enjoy my senses." That\'s a mistake,
because if they were to stop and think, "When there is an unsatisfied
desire, is that pleasant? Is that what I want?" They would realise that
it isn\'t, or, "Can I fulfil desire by giving in to it?" No, you can
never fulfil desire, because the point of desire is to stay a desire.

**Q:** It's based on non-satisfaction.

**Nm:** Exactly, it requires non-satisfaction for it to be. That\'s why
if you stop and think about it you realise the only reason you are
engaged with sensuality is because the pressure of sensual desire is
unpleasant and you don\'t know any other escape from that pressure other
than the temporary release of sensual indulgence.

That\'s the whole point, whenever you encounter any form of displeasure,
your only way of trying to deal with it is through acts of sensuality,
which is why and how people turn to food, music, sexual intercourse or
even meditation hoping for some pleasurable experience to lift them up
when they\'re feeling down or depressed, they just commit harder to
sensual activity, because that\'s the only thing that seemingly relieves
oneself of that pressure. However, you\'re just making it worse because
the more you\'re dependent on running away from that pressure of sensual
desire, the more pressure that desire will exercise over you.

**Q:** So what should you do?

**Nm:** Well,in a way, you don\'t have to do anything. If you start
seeing your own sensual desires as something that\'s controlling you,
something that you are enslaved by, then you have to start seeing that
'nature' before you give into the desire. And then it becomes obvious,
clear as day, that it\'s very unpleasant. Even sometimes when you can
satisfy your desires, but maybe not quick enough, that\'s unpleasant.
Either way, that desire is rooted in a disagreeable feeling, i.e. that
pressure that\'s very unpleasant. So if you want to free yourself from
it, you have to first start restraining your senses and from making it
worse through giving in to that pressure of desire.

You\'re training yourself to be stronger than something else. But in
order to start doing that, you need to start resisting that thing. If
you just habitually give into desire, and at the same time expect to
somehow magically be free from the pressure of the desire, well that\'s
just a contradiction in terms. Restraint needs to come first if you want
to be free from desire. Then the obvious painful nature of the desire in
itself becomes apparent. Initially when people start restraining, they
notice more pain and they assume that it\'s because of their restraint.
But it isn\'t. The restraint cannot cause you pain, it can only reveal
the underlying pain of the desire that is already there.

Imagine that you\'re tied to five powerful animals and they are running
towards the objects of their desire, you naturally run with them to
avoid that extra painful pull that you will experience if you try
standing your ground. The animals are stronger than you, they pull you.
It\'s unpleasant. But that doesn\'t mean that that initial pain is not
there if you run with them. Running with them enables them to pull you
even harder. So initially, you have to accept that sharp pain of
restraint, which eventually you can see that actually it\'s not the
restraint that\'s the problem, the restraint just shows you what happens
when these animals are pulling in their respective domains. If the
animals wouldn\'t be pulling, there wouldn\'t be any pain revealed by
the restraint. Imagine the animals are tamed and calm, and they just
move around slowly and you can just remain seated and not have to run
with them. You are restrained, the senses are tamed and there is no
pull, no pain.

It\'s something anybody could benefit from, just learning how to say no
to themselves, gradually, in regards to this and that, in regard to
unnecessary things like luxuries and indulgences. Because each time you
give in carelessly like that, the animals get more to feed on which
means they get more powerful, which means each time they pull you,
you\'ll be less and less able to resist those desires.

Quite often, and I\'m pretty sure many people can relate, your own
desires take you to places you don\'t want to be, that you know you will
regret even before you go there, yet you can\'t help it and you\'re just
dragged there. How will it then be when old age or sickness sets in?
When your senses start to fail, yet your mind is fully dependent on that
pleasure that you get from that temporary satisfaction of your desires.
When the only resemblance of relief from any disagreeable feelings, is
now taken away. When the senses can\'t enjoy sense objects anymore, when
eyes can barely see, when it\'s hard to hear, when it\'s difficult to
chew, when the body doesn\'t move correctly, when it\'s not young and
doesn\'t have that much energy. Yet your mind is dependent on that
constant chasing after sense pleasures and now that\'s just taken away.
How will it be when the unpleasant feelings arise, and they will, and
you have even less ground to deal with it.

**Q:** It will feel like an unwanted solitary confinement.

**Nm:** Exactly. That\'s why people are terrified of solitude. They can
no longer escape what they have been running away from.

## 28hh- Sense Of Shame And Fear Of Wrongdoing

**Q:** Authenticity, self-honesty, sense of shame and a fear of
wrongdoing, these are all prerequisites for developing freedom from
suffering, but what about guilt?

**Nyanamoli:** Those necessary qualities prevent you from doing
unwholesome things based on greed, aversion and delusion. If you don't
have those qualities preventing you from bad behaviour, then there are
only circumstances around you preventing you, and if circumstances
around you are in favour of shamelessness, then you certainly won't be
keeping your behaviour in check. That's why it's good to have a sense of
shame, even if you don't necessarily have wisdom or restraint in place,
at least that sense of shame will keep you from becoming like an animal
in terms of your behaviour. That's why it's called "a guardian of the
world". As the Buddha said, if there were no sense of shame, sons would
be sleeping with mothers and sisters, and fathers with daughters, it
would be as wild as the animal realm.

> "Monks, these two bright qualities guard the world. Which two? Sense
> of shame and fear of wrongdoing. If these two bright qualities did not
> guard the world, there would be no recognition of 'mother' here, no
> recognition of 'mother's sister,' 'uncle's wife,' 'teacher's wife,' or
> 'wife of those who deserve respect.' The world would be immersed in
> promiscuity, like rams with goats, roosters with pigs, or dogs with
> jackals. But because these two bright qualities guard the world, there
> is recognition of 'mother,' 'mother's sister,' 'uncle's wife,'
> 'teacher's wife,' & 'wife of those who deserve respect.'"

> -- [AN
> 2.9](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an02/an02.009.than.html)

**Q:** Human beings have an inherent sense of shame. You can sense when
you're doing something wrong.

**Nm:** There is a natural sense of shame, in regard to nudity, body
exposure, lewd course words, stealing, lying, and so on. If there wasnt
that natural shame, we would be getting up to all sorts of bad
behaviour, leading to mental decline and complete chaos. When you're
honest and authentic, that sense of shame is what gets revealed. It's
not about becoming morally judgmental. That just comes out of ill will
and repression. No, if you're authentic, then you realise that there are
things that you don't necessarily want to do with others or to be known
publicly, which means then, because you're authentic, you wouldn't be
doing it. And if you have guilt on account of past behaviours, instead
of denying it, ignoring it, you accept the guilt as a result of what
you've done carelessly and then next time, it will make you think twice,
because you're not running away from the disagreeable feeling of guilt,
you're accepting it. And sometimes it can endure for days, and then come
back again and again, maybe even for years later, but each time it comes
you must accept it.

It's good to be guilt free. And the only way to be guilt free is through
fully accepting guilt and then going beyond it. Not by ignoring it or
denying it. And that is exactly the case, people feel that inherent
sense of shame but they blame society for it. I mean, yes, society has a
lot of play in the degree of shaming, but there is that threshold, which
is the natural shame. And some people have more of it, some people have
less of it. But then people find that natural shame to be a problem
because it can be unpleasant if it's preventing them from doing what
they want to do. And then yes, they tend to blame society, or blame the
culture, they rebel against it, they try to override it. But that's a
completely misplaced effort. The better effort is to accept that there
is a place for the natural degree of shame in regard to doing things
that are inappropriate, not because someone says so but because you
recognise that certain actions lead to your own harm, to the harm of
others and do not lead you to wisdom or contentment, and that if there
was no sense of shame, you would easily be acting in ways that would not
be in your best interest.

For example, you can see the dogs that go into a village because they
caught the scent of a female on heat. They sense that they're most
likely going to be attacked and maybe seriously injured by all the other
pack dogs. But they're just focussed on that female and lose what little
perspective they had. Their senses just pull them into that direction
where they get attacked and suffer many unfortunate consequences. They
can't factor the consequences in because the mind doesn't possess the
same powers of reflection as the human mind. That's why they don't have
a natural sense of shame. But for most people, they do have that
recognition which will be guarding them from going in directions which
are extremely unwholesome and lead to further suffering.

**Q:** How do you develop that sense of shame?

**Nm:** By becoming more self transparent, by keeping your desires in
check. Then you will realise that with or without the sense of shame,
you are the one responsible for saying yes to desires and following
them, because it doesn't matter what thoughts your mind might be
presenting you, in forms of the desire, possibilities for things you
want to do, that doesn't matter. What matters is whether you accept it,
following through with it or not. So with self-honesty, you don't blame
society, the government, you don't blame your genes, "Oh, that's how I
was born". Even if all those things are in play, you are always
responsible for the consequences of your choices. For example, a person
trying to give up an addiction, can reflect on the consequences of their
actions, but when that desire is present they don't see consequences
relevant on the same level, as where the addiction is, but if you are
self honest, you will be able to allow whatever pressing desire arises
and have enough space to not give in to it, to not be hooked by it.
However, you have to start seeing benefits even in that initial
restraint. If you don't, then it wont work. There won't be enough ground
for any proper development, because without that basic restraint
beforehand, you won't be able to allow desire to come close without you
acting upon it. As soon as it arises, you'll be acting upon it. The
restraining prevents it, it doesn't mean it's gonna make things easier,
but it will be more peaceful later on. The mind grows from it and until
then, it's gonna reveal the underlying pain beneath the desire and lack
of restraint.

## 29hh- What Is Wisdom?

**Q:** What is discernment or wisdom?

**Nm:** It\'s knowing the Nature of things, knowing things in their
Nature. That doesn\'t mean gathering up or retaining information about
things, that's on the level of intelligence, which can help, for
example, with getting some information about where or how to look for
the Nature of a present experience, Nature of feelings, Nature of
perception, Nature of suffering, Nature of things that matter. Wisdom is
not dependent on a high degree of intelligence or vast amounts of
information storage, but by the right effort you put towards discerning
the Nature of things that matter. People are born with different degrees
of intelligence, but wisdom is developed, through effort, restraint,
calming of your mind, or not giving into craving and desires- the
"corruptions of the mind and weakeners of wisdom".

**Q:** What is the Nature of things?

**Nm:** Things differ in their particular nature, but universally, they
share the same Nature. For example, the Nature of all
*sankharas*/determinations is *anicca*/subject to change and
*dukkha*/unsatisfactory, and the Nature of all *dhammas*/things, is
*anatta*/they cannot be owned, they cannot be yours, they don\'t belong
to you, they are there and you can use them,but you\'re making a grave
error in maintaining your assumption of ownership in regard to them.
That\'s the root of all the problems. It\'s not the usage of things,
it\'s the assumption of ownership that you maintain on that mental
level. That\'s the Nature you want to be concerned about. As in, you can
investigate other natures, but that\'s all relative, you want to come to
the root, the 'Nature of all things', which is impermanence,
unsatisfactory, and cannot be yours. That\'s all that really matters.

Noble wisdom or discernment takes you beyond things, you\'re no longer
affected by them. You cannot be accessed by them. Why? Because you have
removed that assumption of ownership which was based on
*avijja*/ignorance. If you fully understand that things are not yours,
you will no longer be emotionally affected by what happens to them. That
is wisdom. That is elevation of the mind, which means a greater
perspective on things. All the decisions that intelligent and
non-intelligent people make in their life, is based upon the height or
degree of their perspective. The greater the perspective, the wiser they
become. They might not necessarily be ultimately wise and know the way
out of suffering, but they\'re certainly wiser in relation to those who
have no perspective, who are just like animals, slaves to their senses
and sense desires, overwhelmed and absorbed into sensual perceptions. So
that\'s another way you can describe wisdom - it\'s the height of your
perspective. The higher the wisdom, the less of an emotional involvement
with things you have, which means that the ultimate wisdom is the
complete surmounting and detachment from feelings and suffering.

> -- [SN 56.11](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11)

**Q:** Ajahn, can you describe the Four Noble Truths - suffering, the
origin, the cessation and the path to cessation?

**Nm:** First and foremost, those are four aspects of one insight, that
insight being, freedom from suffering. If you\'re free from suffering,
then it already implies the knowledge of what suffering is, the
knowledge of what has been causing that suffering, the knowledge of
freedom from suffering and knowledge of how that freedom from suffering
is brought to fulfilment. It\'s not like 1-2-3-4 steps that a person
needs to discern one by one, it\'s about understanding suffering and
freedom from it.

The cause of suffering is nothing other than craving, which is something
that people might just read over because it seems to make perfect sense.
One might think that they perfectly understand what that means, but, in
terms of the direct insight or understanding that 'craving is
suffering', that should result in liberation from that suffering.
'Seeing/Understanding the craving as suffering' means 'abandoning the
craving'. So the only reason you crave is because you don\'t real y see
it directly, you don\'t understand it, you haven\'t discerned that truth
despite having read about it. The important aspect is to recognise that
whenever there is suffering present (including the liability to suffer),
you can induce correctly, that the craving must be present because the
suffering is there.

When the suffering is present means it\'s because simultaneously with
it, there is craving present. The absence of that craving simultaneously
means the absence of that suffering, there is no delay. That\'s why you
can have direct knowledge of freedom from suffering directly veri ed for
yourself, "Oh, I cannot suffer amidst things that used to make me
suffer, the mind cannot suffer now because there is no more craving in
regard to those things."

> "He whom life no longer torments, who does not grieve at death, If
> that immovable one is one who has seen the state of peace, in the
> midst of sorrow he does not sorrow."
>
> For the monk who has cut off craving for being, whose mind is at
> peace, Having totally destroyed the perpetuation of birth, for him
> there is no more being.\"

> -- [Udāna 4.9](https://suttacentral.net/ud4.9)

**Q:** How to abandon craving?

**Nm:** By developing virtue and sense restraint to the extent
necessary, whereby you start discerning your mental intentions, whether
they\'re rooted in wholesome or unwholesome, whether they\'re rooted in
greed, aversion, delusion, and when you know that they are, you do not
engage in them, you do not tolerate them, you do not entertain them, you
do not proliferate or invest in them. That will enable the mind to then
not resist the unpleasant feeling, to not indulge the pleasant feeling,
to not try to distract yourself from a neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant
feeling. And when the mind stops doing that, with the previous knowledge
that it received from outside, through the Suttas or a wise teacher,
with the previous knowledge of what craving is, you will be able to see,
"This is the absence of craving", and you will be able to see right
there, "There is no suffering", and then you will also be able to
understand what that suffering was, even the suffering of the past,
before you understood the way out. You wouldn\'t be suffering on account
of that either. The same knowledge will be applied to the present, past
and future.

**Q:** How to endure those painful feelings?

**Nm:** If you want to give into sensuality, ill-will, or distraction,
you don\'t give in, that will result in you enduring them.

**Q:** Then how does one know that one is free from craving?

**Nm:** When there\'s no suffering amidst things that used to be
suffering. There\'s no suffering because you cannot suffer, not because
you\'re hiding away or just avoiding things. Avoiding things means
you\'re afraid of something already. For example, say a person doesn\'t
leave their house, because they don\'t want to talk to anyone, because
it might annoy them, and then they\'l suffer. They are not free from
suffering, they\'re just protecting their precious environment of
circumstantial non-disturbance, but the fact that they must protect it
means that they are disturbed, which means they\'re not free from
suffering but only hiding away from the greater extent of their
suffering.

You need to have self honesty. So, if you know that you\'re not hiding
away, not indulging in sensual pleasures, not covering anything up, then
with that self honesty and restraint of the senses, seeing the danger in
the slightest fault, moderation in eating, that will result in being
mindful of your actions. Which means that the mind is already developing
a certain perspective which is needed to discern the intentions behind
your actions.

There is no craving without intention, but there is intention without
craving. That\'s why an arahant can still intend, decide and choose, but
he has no craving. In order for you to see that, you have to see the
intentions, and most people are not even aware of their mental
intentions. They think intention is an obvious choice. But it\'s not,
it\'s a subtle inclination. Thoughts in themselves are already
intentional. It\'s subtle and in order to reach that subtle level, sense
restraint and virtue, moderation in eating and mindfulness is absolutely
necessary. Paired with the right instruction, and the right way of
looking (*yonisomanasikara*), that\'s where the practice is. Without the
right instruction, it's just restraint, which is good, but it doesn\'t
lead you to any knowledge. With the right instruction and that way of
living (which brings about a greater perspective), that\'s all you need.

Sometimes people might think, "Restraint is not the Dhamma". That\'s
true, and then they would think, "Okay, well, now I got the Dhamma. So
now I don\'t have to restrain myself". No, Dhamma applies only where the
restraint is. Yes, restraint is not the Dhamma, as in, the application
of the Dhamma is not the same as the necessary basis for that
application, but you wouldn\'t be able to apply it if there is no
necessary basis.

If the mind practices like that, with self-transparency, then the
inclination in the form of craving becomes more and more obvious. Why?
Because you start recognising that in certain ways that you intend or
incline, you suffer, you make yourself more liable to suffering, you
feel too much, you become emotional y sensitive, you become too
involved, you become exposed to future suffering, and by discerning
those things, you stop intending like that, and by not intending like
that, you\'re not perpetuating the craving.

Craving is always in relation to feelings. In a present agreeable
feeling, you have to discern the inclination towards wanting more of it,
wanting it to stay longer, wanting it to not go away too soon, wanting
to increase it, to intensify it, to prolong it, any of those things. In
a disagreeable feeling, be it a general disagreeable mood or something
more specific, you have to discern the inclination towards resisting it,
towards trying to find the justification for it, towards trying to nd an
explanation for it, towards psychologizing it. Any of those things are
just mechanisms that you try to engage in, so to remove it, to get rid
of it. And the subtlest of feelings is the
neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant, when paired with craving, results in
inclinations towards distraction, delusion, indolence, laziness, mental
heedlessness.

If you don\'t incline towards a present feeling, in any of those three
ways, you will no longer be feeding *taṇhā*/craving.

**Q:** One should then be aware of feelings?

**Nm:**...to the extent that they have arisen on their own. Feelings
arise, and having arisen, they cease on their own. You have no say in
that. That\'s what 'mindfulness of feeling' means \'discerning their
nature\', knowing that they have arisen on their own. For example, this
present pleasant experience has arisen on its own. That\'s fine, so you
don\'t have to try to get rid of it, thinking, "Arisen pleasure means
craving!" No, it doesn\'t. Leaning towards that pleasure means craving.
Leaning away from the displeasure means craving. Leaning towards
forgetfulness and distraction when there is
neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling, means craving.

**Q:** So really you have to be aware of those leanings?

**Nm:** Yes, that\'s a good way to start. You can\'t see craving
directly, because craving is in your attitude of "leaning". You can
bring it down so precisely whereby you can see, either the presence of
suffering or the possibility to suffer. You can use that knowledge to
see the 'leaning'.

**Q:** There\'s no method that can show you that?

**Nm:** No, because method is on the level of bodily action or bodily
perceptions, where you\'re just perceiving or going through some
motions. We\'re talking about the intentions behind your actions. So
whatever meditation method/techniques or bodily act you do, you still
have to look at the intention behind that, which means that a
"meditation method" becomes redundant, which means the only necessary
method is your sila and sense restraint. That is the closest to a right
method as you can get.

**Q:** So it\'s not about doing a meditation of observing bodily-touch
sensations or breathing techniques, etc. which will reveal the truth or
remove my craving?

**Nm:** That\'s a completely misplaced effort, because you are looking
in the wrong place. You\'re not seeing your intention to observe
sensations. Your intention is not in the sense of bodily touch or in the
movement of your breathing. Observing bodily sensations, audible
sensations, visual sensations, etc, is an action which is already
intended, which is already "leaned towards and away from" and you\'re
not seeing that, by not seeing that, no amount of engaging in sense
perceptions, will reveal its nature. Otherwise the Buddha would have
given such a method and described it in the Suttas. When they did ask
him about a direct method, he said, a young man develops faith and goes
forth, leaving his household life, he lives restrained by the rules of
*patimokkha*, practices sense restraint, sees the danger in the
slightest fault, moderate in eating and devoted to wakefulness, mindful
and aware, dispelling the hindrances, and practicing jhana.

I remember the first time I read that as a layman, I was also looking
for a method. And I thought, "Well, this instruction is just too
general, why wouldn\'t he just give you a particular recipe on how to
become awakened?", because there isn\'t any, this is the most particular
you can get. If you\'re not seeing it in a direct manner, it\'s just
because of all of the wrong views you are looking with. You need to meet
the Buddha's instruction halfway basically, or even two thirds of the
way to start making sense of it. But if a person doesn\'t change their
views and only adds to the top of their views and notions of what the
practice is, that\'s when you get methods such as modern day vipassana,
visualisation or concentration techniques.

You have to discern the intention behind your action and you can\'t
concentrate on that because it\'s behind your act of concentration. You
can only discern it, you can know it.

**Q:** You can\'t attend to or concentrate on your intention, you can
only be aware of it.

**Nm:** You can be aware in a peripheral background manner, but
attention or concentration in terms of techniques is not the same thing.
People are not aware of the background, when they\'re doing meditation
techniques, quite the opposite, they absorb into the foreground, trying
to narrow things down. They\'re practising a focusing attention exercise
on one thing or the other, which means that there\'s no general
awareness there, and if they hear about 'general awareness', that
becomes a thing which they try to focus on.

Your intentions can only be seen indirectly on the basis of sense
restraint and sila. You can\'t see them indirectly if you\'re
unrestrained or restrained and looking in the wrong place, such as
focusing on objects of your attention.(In both cases your attention is
leaning towards the foreground of senses objects and you are oblivious
to the background) (In that sense common meditation techniques are
redundant)

Having enough clarity generated to the point of being able to fully
discern the background, will not come about if you are not restrained in
virtue and a meditation technique cannot replace that. If you are
restrained in virtue, you don\'t need a meditation technique, because
your intentions will be clear enough for you to then start the work of
bringing about the end of craving by no longer giving in to it.

## On Nanavira Thera's *Notes on Dhamma* - "Anicca"

**Q:** This is in regards to Ven. Nanavira\'s, shorter notes on ​anicca​
and the sutta quotes found there :

> **\"In the Khandha Samyutta (iv,6 \<S.iii,38\>) it is said of rūpa,
> vedanā, saññā, sankhārā, and viññāna: uppādo paññāyati; vayo
> paññāyati; thitassa aññathattam paññāyati. (\'Arising (appearance) is
> manifest; disappearance is manifest; change while standing is
> manifest\...\"**

It seems at first glance, one would think that the order would be
different, that it would be \"arising, then changing while standing, and
then ceasing\". Is there a reason why it isn\'t in that particular
order?

**Nm:** Because that order is rooted in a wrong view of the external
point of view in regards to the experience, in regards to the
fundamentals of space and time. People assume the external world, which
is independent of me and my experience, and that external world
possesses time in which we are placed, so to speak. So, \'time\', stands
for that external assumption of yourself. You think that you have arisen
and you\'re enduring and then you\'re ceasing, but that requires an
external reference point to see that kind of flow, which is actually
impossible to see because you can\'t step outside of yourself. You can
have that notion of a flow, or of flux in regards to external things
around you, in regard to objects of your senses, but you cannot have
that kind of reference point in regards to your own senses. That\'s why
it can only be described and seen internally, phenomenologically, which
is how the Buddha described it, \"arising is manifest, or disappearing
is manifest, or changing while standing is manifest\". If you look at
the nature of arising, it\'s like fading in, which means there is no
first point before which thing wasn\'t and then it is, as though you can
catch the moment where it appeared, that\'s impossible, that can only be
done in an external manner. But when you\'re trying to apply to your own
situation, and the senses, the sense bases, you cannot see it like that.

If you look at it, you see that it\'s either already fading in or fading
out. Doesn\'t matter which, it is persisting while changing or changing
while standing. Why? Because if you have something \'fading in\', it
means it\'s increasing in its presence, which means it\'s staying the
same thing while it\'s increasing its presence. And that\'s just another
way of saying it\'s \'changing while remaining the same\'. If something
is fading out, as in, it\'s de-intensifying in its presence. Again, it
stays the same thing, you can still designate it as the same thing,
while it\'s changing as in \'fading out\'. So whether it\'s arising or
disappearing, you can say that it\'s persisting while changing, just in
a different direction.

That\'s why the Buddha described it in that order: ​*\"arising is
manifest, ceasing is manifest, persisting while changing is
manifest\"*,​ the three ways of looking at an arisen phenomena, either
intensifying or de-intensifying, which, either way, is to see it as
changing while remaining the same.

**Q:** What\'s often heard in meditation instructions, is this idea of
having to watch things constantly change, and or trying to capture
nanosecond changes so that you can have an insight etc.

**Nm:** Yes, it\'s unfortunate but not surprising. The external point of
view of ourselves is one of the fundamental wrong views that can be
manifested. It can manifest itself in different ways but contemporarily,
the most common way is the scientific outlook. As in you see yourself
inhabiting this public world, that is there before you and it\'s going
to carry on after you, But any notions of the world that you can have,
it\'s based on your experience as a whole and your sense bases. Thus,
you having a view that it\'s independent of *\"​that because of
which​\"* that view is there in the first place, that\'s why it\'s a
wrong view.

Any notion of flux requires a non-changing reference point. So, you can
see things are flowing against THIS. And you can do that in regards to
your sense objects. But you cannot do that in regard to your sense
bases, as in, you cannot step outside of the five aggregates and your
situation as a whole and then see it constantly changing or even worse,
measure the nano fractions of it. That\'s unthinkable. But you can come
up with a pleasing theory and a very neat description of it. But that
would require a person to inhabit the wrong view of the external world
in regards to himself and then everything will make sense. But because
it\'s rooted in that misperception of the fundamental aspects of your
situation, it cannot result in any knowledge or wisdom.

**Q:** He writes shortly after:

> **\"These three sankhatassa sankhatalakkhanāni (Anguttara III,v,7
> \<A.i,152\>), or characteristics whereby what is determined (i.e. a
> sankhata dhamma) may be known as such (i.e. as sankhata), concisely
> indicate the fundamental structure in virtue of which things are
> things---in virtue of which, that is to say, things are distinct, one
> from another. It is also in virtue of this structure that all
> experience, including the arahat\'s, is intentional (see CETANĀ) or
> teleological (i.e. that things are significant, that they point to
> other, possible, things\...\"**

**Nm:** \"Changing while remaining the same,\" requires at least two
different levels of that generality, requires a certain sameness while
within that, simultaneously present to that sameness, that thing is
changing, until it\'s changed to such a degree that then abruptly you
just see how it\'s a different thing present there, as in your
experience has changed. So, that in itself is already intentional. The
things on the lower level of generality, that\'s why he talks about the
fundamental structure, are bound by that general determination of
\'still being the same thing\'. When that changes to a greater degree
that determination ceases. And that\'s the basis of any intentionality.
That\'s the basis of any choices you can make. The possibilities that
are implied in the given experience as a whole, are within that
experience as a whole. And in return, they actually determined that
experience as a whole for how you know it.



## 41hh- Contemplation and Awareness

### Discerning the background

**Thaniyo:** In terms of contemplating the 32 parts of the body, how do
you do that correctly? You actually cannot see your brain, your lungs,
intestines, etc. And when you think about it, when you want to
contemplate your brain, your lungs, etc, then what is there is actually
an idea, a thought. So actually now I'm attending to that thought, and
then I'm picking up the signs of those things.

**Nyanamoli:** Yes, that's the difference there. The only way people
approach this, the only way they would know how, is through
attending---in other words, they would be attending that thought as if
that's really attending to your brain, which you can't. So, the only way
to see these body parts correctly, in the relevant contemplation manner,
is indirectly, without attending to them directly as objects of your
attention. You are to discern them as that-because-of-which you are here
living, attending to things.

That's the difference between doing body contemplation rightly and
wrongly. Wrongly is basically just repeating these parts, visualizing
them and thinking that that somehow equates to understanding them. It
might provide you an initial kind of reduction of sensual craving,
because you never think about those things, but very soon you'll get
used to it and it'll become meaningless because you can't see those
things directly. That's why in paṭiccasamuppāda the saḷāyatana (the
six-sense base) is the ultimate indirect, it's the ultimate peripheral.
It's the ultimate that-because-of-which-there-is-the-world-for-you, that
because of which you are the perceiver, you are the conceiver of it.
That's why when the Buddha describes the six-sense base, it's described
in that almost external, medical manner---the fleshy eye, the nose and
so on---because that's the closest you can see it. You can't see it
directly: you cannot attend to your eye, you can only attend to the
object.

But that's not the eye because of which you see things. You are
misconceiving it, thinking that that's the eye because of which you see
things. You start assuming that you can attend that because of which
your attention is there. You have to stop trying to attend to the eye,
the nose, and start discerning it as a basis, as a physical basis for
the world to exist for you. In the same sense, you can be attending to a
cup, attending to a table, attending to the image of your brain, but
you're just regarding these things as overly objectified objects of your
attention. In a way, they have something in common---they're all
material. But you don't want to regard your brain just as you regard a
cup, because a cup is insignificant to you---you want to discern that
that objective brain that you're thinking about is the reason for your
subjectivity, because of which you're able to attend to the idea of the
brain in the first place.

**Thaniyo:** So, I have to keep reminding myself of that?

**Nyanamoli:** Well, you might have to initially, to remind yourself to
recreate the right order of things---so that you can dwell on it---but
after a while, you don't have to: it will be enough just to remember it,
because you will know how to look indirectly. You will know how to see
things without having to look at them.

People might misunderstand when I mention 'the simultaneous presence'.
They might end up thinking it's like two things at the same time,
momentarily present in front of you. But when I say 'simultaneous
presence'---and that is the way the Suttas talk about it---it's
basically two things that are present on two different levels. It
doesn't mean they are there equally present at the same time for a
second or two, and then you must catch them both at the same time. It is
not like that, because you are just trying to catch one thing. You can
divide it into a mil ion sub-parts---your attention is still looking at
that foreground of an object.

But when we talk about the simultaneous presence, we are saying it
endures: the peripheral endures. For example, you have an image of your
brain, but you don't overly attend to it as a random object in the world
of which you tell yourself "This body is not mine." It is not like that,
but you have to see that image of the brain without misconceiving it,
and then you start discerning that this is the closest you can get to
that which your life actually depends upon, that form. The closest you
can get is through these images of the brain, lungs, heart, blood, and
so on. You realize all of them stand for that, because of which you are
conscious here living this life, but you can't possibly enter that brain
in the way of accessing it through your perception, or anything like
that. Why? Because it precedes it. But you can know that the image of
the brain that you have on that peripheral level is that because of
which you're able to be present here and now, and attend to these
various other things that arise. In other words, when you stop thinking
about the brain, your knowledge that that's the order of your
experience---meaning you're undermined by the matter---doesn't change.

That's what I mean when I say it's simultaneously present. You don't
have to keep thinking about it. You can actually forget about it, but
rightly. It would basically constitute rightful forgetfulness, which is
when your forgetfulness does not induce avijjā anymore. You don't have
to keep thinking---it's impossible to keep thinking about everything all
the time.

**Thaniyo:** That makes sense since you can't really think "Brain...
brain... brain" all the time.

**Nyanamoli:** Exactly, because you just keep forcing it into the
foreground, and then you fail to see what the peripheral is, which means
you have now overly misconceived the brain and you're making it into an
object of your perception, which it is impossible for it to be. The eye
cannot see itself.

Let me say it like this: for example, you think about the brain rightly,
peripherally. You discern the image of the brain, meaning you recognize
there is the brain in here because of which my experience still exists,
and then you stop thinking about it. And then three hours later you
think about it again, and it's important here to introduce the attitude
if you have to---eventually, you will recognize it as such. It's
important, when three hours later you think about the brain again, you
recognize that it's the same brain that has been here this whole time.
The fact that you forgot about it did not make it not there.

The same applies with moods or feelings. For example, you have a present
mood arisen---it's sort of agreeable, but then you start attending to
more particular things, and of course you don't go around thinking how
agreeable your day is. But then, later on, four or six hours later, you
look back and you remember it again---that it was agreeable. It's the
same mood. And that's what I mean when I say you have to let it endure.
That means that when you bring it back, you don't make it yours, but you
recognize it as it has been enduring on its own. That's how you start
discerning the simultaneous principle I'm talking about. Simultaneous in
the sense that the general mood---the general notion of the matter being
there---for example, in the contemplation of the body---it's been there
enduring on its own, whether you thought about it or not. So, when you
do remember, you will eventually stop giving priority to the thought "I
remembered this" and "I'm attending to this" and "I'm practicing
this"---you will just find it. It's simultaneously present with
everything else you do, when you don't attend to that. It's the
necessary basis, basically, for your action, for your choice, for your
attention.

**Thaniyo:** So, we should develop the domain, the background. So, one
wants to develop it but in the process of that, he forgets about it.

**Nyanamoli:** You develop it by learning how to discern that it's
already there.

**Thaniyo:** Sure, but then...

**Nyanamoli:** Then you have to forget about it.

**Thaniyo:** After a minute?

**Nyanamoli:** After a minute, that's fine. Then when you remember it,
you want to abandon the attitude of "I must restart this practice
because I forgot about it." Instead of that, you want to develop
recognition and think: "Oh, yes, it's still there." That's pretty much
the crucial difference that I'm talking about. Many people say "Be here
now... be present... just feel... just this, it's just like that" and
whatnot, but it all revolves around just telling yourself: "Come back to
the present moment, come back to the present moment." You want to
recognize that when you come back to the present moment, you can only do
so because it was there enduring beforehand.

Then you realize you can't forget about it even if you want to. You're
responsible for your own ignorance, because you're responsible for the
attitude of thinking you have to hold it in front of you and that's the
only way for it to exist. You forget about it after a minute, then you
remember it after five minutes, and then you think "Oh, crap! I forgot
about it. I must do it again now," as if you are the one who does it to
begin with. It is not like that! Each time that attitude arises, you
include that attitude in your mindfulness as well because it's not
rooted in you, but it's rooted in the enduring background.

That's what the mind is---the ultimate background, citta nimitta. That's
why it is said: "He knows the mind as exalted or as shrunk or as
depressed or as elated." These states that people almost automatically
appropriate are your state of mind. As such, it endures. Five days
later, you remember it again. The only reason you can remember it, is
because it's still there enduring to some extent. And what will that do,
this kind of practice of mindfulness? Well , you can't be treading water
with it. If you keep doing it, it is forcing you basically to shift the
center of your experience from your sense of self into the background of
things, and even the actual things that you're attending to, because you
realize that they're there because of the background, you start
squeezing your own sense of self out. There is no room for it in the
experience because whether you look at the background, or whether you're
attending to the foreground, you realize this can be done only because
these things endure on their own, beforehand.

Therefore, stop worrying about not forgetting, but instead start
focusing on discerning whenever you remember and don't misconceive
whenever you remember. And the most fundamental misconceiving is the
idea "mine", meaning that "I am" here, at the center---not this thing
that I remembered because of which I am in the first place.

**Thaniyo:** If I understand correctly, whatever I attend to, at any
given time, that must induce a remembering of the way things are.

**Nyanamoli:** Well , you don't even have to say it like that, but you
can just say: "Whatever I attend to, just be aware of what I'm doing."
Include yourself in that picture. And where that sense of self is,
that's already where the background is. Instead of feeling that each
time you remember, you must restart the practice and then hold it as
long as you can. Then you drop that whole attitude of trying to remember
but instead, whenever you remember, even if it's once a day, you still
don't think: "Oh, now I remembered, I must hold it." Instead you should
think: "I remembered it, it's already there, arisen beforehand. Not
mine, not for me, not myself. It cannot be mine." And that automatically
affects everything else within that background, within that peripheral.

It's going to take time to see that because now the emphasis is on what
you attend to---that's what matters. In practice you are thinking: "I'm
attending to this, I'm attending to this," and then you forget and try
to remember it again. But that is not the way, because the only reason
you can attend to anything is because it is there given as an option,
which means it exists on the peripheral, where the possibilities exist.

Things are genuinely impermanent, and cannot be owned, and cannot be
control ed. But you can't see that because you depend on telling
yourself that things are genuinely impermanent, cannot be owned and so
on. You can attend to all sorts of things, but that thing is still there
on its own, that's the important bit. That's how you shift it onto the
phenomenon that has arisen and is enduring, not onto you attending it.
That's how you place yourself second basically. And when the sense of
self is second, it's not a sense of self any more. To have the sense of
self it has to always be the first, the master.

**Thaniyo:** Then I might start thinking about other things.

**Nyanamoli:** If you start thinking about other things, you use the
same principle of all owing your mind to get established on the
significance of that peripheral, and then let it go. Let your mind think
about other things.

Basically, establishing that significance would create that enduring
context. But you don't have to keep thinking "this is the context",
because it's there. You just let it endure. And then you might wonder
what to do then. You don't do anything. You let your mind think. Just
make sure it doesn't go into sensuality, ill-will or cruelty. That's it.
That's all you have to do. Just prevent it from going there. If it
doesn't want to go there, you don't have to do anything. That's how you
make your own sense of self redundant.

**Thaniyo:** What about doubt?

**Nyanamoli:** That's also how you go beyond doubt. If your mind is
established on the peripheral---upon the nature of an enduring
phenomenon---no amount of active movements of your mind, all of that is
secondary to that enduring significance that you've established, so you
can't doubt it. You can doubt what you're attending to, but the
background of your attention is that which you cannot attend to, and you
cannot doubt that if you start discerning it. If you keep confusing it
and thinking that you can attend to the background of your
attention---in the same sense you think you can see the eye because of
which you see---then you're still affected by doubt.

That's what Ven. Ñāṇavīra was talking about when he wrote about the
self-identity of a self-enduring phenomenon that people confuse with
their own self-identity. The identity of that thing is still there, it's
still the same thing. In that sense, you are responsible for
establishing your mind correctly, only to let it go and all ow that
establishment to endure. If done rightly it will endure. That's how you
enter jhānas.

That's why it was said in the suttas that a monk doesn't think "I am
entering the jhāna now", or "I will enter the jhāna." But he sets up his
mind, he sets up the right significance, and then the mind gets
established upon the theme of jhāna. And that's why, while that theme is
enduring, all that is implied is the phenomenon of the fact that nothing
that is taken as 'mine' can be owned. Yet it's the reason because of
which you are there in the first place. If you establish your mind like
that, then you won't be able to think---for as long as such a phenomenon
is enduring---"I'm doing this and that" because it's not rooted in you
anymore---it's rooted in a proper foundation, which is the foundation of
the inaccessible matter: the five aggregates that cannot actually be
owned.

**Thaniyo:** How do we know if the knowledge is developed sufficiently
enough?

**Nyanamoli:** Dispassion is the sign, dispassion is the result.

**Thaniyo:** Then is one always aware of the background?

**Nyanamoli:** Sure, because that's not something you attend to.

**Thaniyo:** But then one is always aware of the background.

**Nyanamoli:** Yes, whatever that background is at the time. Hence, the
arahant is always mindful.

**Thaniyo:** It doesn't have to be a specific background.

**Nyanamoli:** No, for as long as people think mindfulness is what you
attend to, then they can't comprehend how an arahant can always be
mindful and not be a robot at the same time. There is always something
enduring, for as long as these aggregates don't break apart. That's what
the Buddha meant when he said: "Or he develops mindfulness to the extent
necessary for final knowledge." Exactly, to the extent. all the things
that were implied in the perception of the beating heart, that's not in
your control---yet it determines your whole life simultaneously while
you're alive---you can go further within the same perception: What is
the characteristic? What are the nimittas of that significance of my
beating heart? It's not in my control. So, my sense of control
fundamentally depends upon the greater domain of non-control, of that
which is inaccessible to my control. That's nothing other than anicca.
So, you develop the perception of impermanence correctly. This thing
cannot be owned, cannot be appropriated, cannot be control ed, it's
impermanent.

**Thaniyo:** Everything that is experienced?

**Nyanamoli:** Yes, the universal characteristics are the most
universal. But as I said, sometimes the mind just won't be getting
established upon it because it's too subtle and it got too distracted or
whatever, so you bring it down. That's why the Buddha had such a varied
range of different approaches. Looking at a dead corpse for example. On
some days that will not be necessary because it will be enough just to
think about the phenomenon of non-control and it will be fully
establishing dispassion, renunciation, relinquishing, and everything
else. But on other days it might be necessary. Either way, you're
developing the same principle.

**Thaniyo:** So, to know that you're developing correctly---when you've
actually got somewhere in development--- is the sign of dispassion
always there?

**Nyanamoli:** If the mind is properly established... Why? Because again
you have shifted the emphasis from me and I, onto the enduring
phenomenon that exists on its own. So even when disagreeable things
arise, it becomes inconceivable to become involved in a personal manner.
It's just like knowing: "The wind blows, the branches fall, the sun
shines, the heart beats, people shout abuse at you." It's on the same
level. That's why the Buddha listed these as elements to be
endured---enduring the malicious speech, the hurtful speech and so on.

**Thaniyo:** So, with the breath, breathing is always there---intention
to breathe, to be more specific. But I can sit now and play with my
breath.

**Nyanamoli:** OK. But you want to know it. Like now, for most people,
because they're so concerned with what they attend to, even the people
who try to practice, breath is pretty much peripheral in regard to their
other actions. The breath goes into the background.

But if you bring the breath into the foreground, as in if you think "I'm
sitting here, breathing in, breathing out...", you don't do it in the
sense of thinking you are going to be attending to this every second.
You bring it to the foreground so that you will see the background of
breathing. For most day-to-day experience, breath is in the background.
And here you can establish significance by asking yourself if you will
be alive if the breathing stops? If your airways get blocked? No. So,
you could establish the same principle as we just did---of dispassion,
relinquishment, non-control, not-self---by seeing the background of your
breath. Or you can think: "Why don't I refine it further and start
seeing the background of the actual act of breathing?" And that's how
the [Ānāpānasati Sutta (MN 118)](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN118.html) goes where it
says: "Knowingly he breathes in, knowingly he breathes out." And you
see, actually it is not like: "I'm breathing in, I'm breathing in, I'm
breathing in" while inhaling and then, "now I'm breathing out, breathing
out, breathing out" while exhaling. That is not how it is said there!
But rather, he's breathing in, breathing out, and he knows it, which
means now he's discerning an even more general background to that,
because that's what's in front of him. He puts his mindfulness to the
fore, as the sutta says. No matter what he thinks, what matters is
knowing the background of that doing. That's how you establish
mindfulness of breathing. Mindfulness is basically synonymous with
background, so when you say mindfulness, you say background. You can cal
mindfulness of breathing as the background of breathing.

**Thaniyo:** What is that background of breathing?

**Nyanamoli:** Well, fundamentally it comes down to the knowledge of
action, any action, because breathing is an action; that would be if you
fully discerned it. But initially what it will be as the background of
breathing is the knowledge of breathing and of the necessity of breath,
the necessity of the body.

When I say the necessity of those things it means you are not necessary,
these things are necessary. It's like narrowing down the field of your
concern. Don't get distracted by "I must do this and that". That's why
the Buddha said: "When you develop this, that body you're discerning
there is that body, the body among the bodies," which means it's the
body that stands for the phenomenon of the body at the time. So, you use
your breathing as a natural confinement for the concern of your thought,
and you become mindful of it properly when you start discerning the
background of that confinement. But, as I said, you discern the
confinement because breathing is already there, whether you attend to it
or not---you certainly don't make a mechanical method out of it,
thinking: "I'll watch my nostrils... watch my nostrils...". There you
don't discern a background, but you're actively looking away from it,
while you're actively trying to focus on what's in front of you.

**Thaniyo:** So, what about this example of when you learn something
like 2 + 2 equals 4. You know that now, so every time you look at 2 +
2---

**Nyanamoli:** The knowledge is there. Imagine the same principle
applied to the universal nature of experience. Whenever you look at
anything that has arisen, you see its cessation. That's the insight of
the sotapanna: "Whatever has the nature of arising...". It doesn't say
"whatever has arisen in front of me is impermanent." "Whatever has the
nature of arising" means it's already a peripheral knowledge. The nature
of a thing is something you cannot attend to. You can discern it based
on things you're attending to. So, you discern that whatever has the
nature of arising, for that reason has to cease.

**Thaniyo:** What is the sign of "arisen"?

**Nyanamoli:** Cessation. Because of its arising, not because it's going
to disappear, but because it has arisen. So, whenever things arise for
you, which is for as long as the five aggregates exist, you see
impermanence.

That's why arahantship is irreversible, Right View is irreversible. You
cannot forget that, because everything contains it. That's why it's such
a general statement---because that's the most accurate way you could say
it. "Whatever has the nature of arising, has the nature of ceasing."
That's it.

**Thaniyo:** So that significance, that sign, is always there because
whatever is manifested is always there.

**Nyanamoli:** Exactly, that is its nature. That's why the dhammā are
the phenomena, and then the Dhamma, as in the Teaching, is the nature of
the phenomena. The phenomenology, literally---the knowledge of the
phenomena. So, whatever has the nature of manifestation, has the nature
of this teaching of the Dhamma, the nature of impermanence and so on.

In practice, you look at the breath, you contemplate the body so as to
keep discerning this nature of manifestation clearer and clearer. It's
already there on its own, manifested. You're not creating it by
attending to it, you can only attend to it because it's already there
enduring. You cannot create anything from nothingness and bring it into
being because you are the result of it. Your attention is already
secondary to it, structurally, not in the sense of a sequence like 1, 2, 3. It's all within the same arisen basis of the present form, paired
with consciousness that you cannot step outside of. Any movement you
make within it, is strictly within it. If you try to attend to that, it
would require you to step outside of it and see it as an object, but
that's inconceivable. And if you keep doing it, it's because you're
misconceiving that you can do it. You want to discern these universal
characteristics of things, not by your attending to them and thinking
they exist only when you attend to them. And that's how you uproot your
sense of self. You can't step outside of yourself or the five
aggregates, but you can certainly stop misconceiving them, and that can
be done only from the inside.

### On sensuality

**Thaniyo:** There is a Sutta from AN 4:181: "How is a bhikkhu a
long-distance shooter? Any kind of form whatsoever, past, future,
present, whatever---a bhikkhu sees all form as it really is with correct
wisdom."

**Nyanamoli:** Yes, so shooting the peripheral discernment. For example,
within the significance of the heart you can discern even further: what
is a more refined significance than this beating heart already implied,
which is the significance of earth, water, re, air. Significance of
impermanence, non-control. So, if a bhikkhu is a long-distance shooter,
it means he doesn't even have to go through, for example, establishing
the significance of the heart to discern these other more refined
signifcances---his mind is already developed to the level of discerning
refined significances in whatever has arisen. And these refined
significances---refined signs---are the impermanence, four great
elements, etc.

**Thaniyo:** The Sutta goes further: "And how is a bhikkhu a
sharpshooter?"

**Nyanamoli:** He goes for the significances that are fundamental to
freedom from suffering basically.

You would arrive at that through contemplating the independence of the
four great elements, your dependence on it, etc. You would eventually
drain away any conceit, any misconceiving, which will result in freedom
from suffering. Or if you shoot precisely, you go straight for freedom
from suffering, because that's already implied.

**Thaniyo:** Because that's like the most general recognition. Whatever
has arisen, will cease, and you develop that.

**Nyanamoli:** That's also what it means to be paññavimutti. One who's
liberated through wisdom because he discerns only things relevant to
liberation. He doesn't develop all the jhānas and everything else, but
discerns the right things to the sufficient extent.

Like now when you speak about it, it will be quite an abstract thing.
But the only reason it's abstract is because the mind hasn't been
developed in regard to that abstraction, so start developing it. Start
discerning it in arisen things that endure for you, in front of you,
throughout your daily life---because these things are there. They will
remain abstract for as long as you don't see them as they are---so you
abstract them, literally.

**Thaniyo:** And then the Sutta goes further: "And how is a bhikkhu one
who splits a great body? Here, a bhikkhu splits the great mass of
ignorance. Possessing these four qualities he's worthy of offerings. And
how is a bhikkhu skilled in places? He's virtuous, seeing the danger in
the slightest fault..."

**Nyanamoli:** That's also where you see the danger---it's in that
peripheral. The danger is in the background---the danger is the
implication of what's in front of you. The danger is the context that
you create. A puthujjana doesn't see the danger in sensuality, but if he
starts thinking about it, discerning it, he'll get to see it because it
is actually dangerous. That's how you can see the danger in the
slightest fault, and not become neurotically obsessed about every little
thing that's in front of you, fearing it---because that's not where the
danger is. That's like the simile of the beautiful, tasty beverage: you
can't see the poison in it, but you know it is there---which means
ultimately the danger of sensuality is rooted in the background, and can
never come in front of you and be seen in the same manner as you see an
object of your senses.

That's why people are intoxicated with sensuality, despite the
experience always proving that it's actually painful---you only regard
things as real if they're the things that you can see through your
senses, usually. So, you want to discern it. And that danger, as I said,
never leaves the peripheral, never becomes something you can see with
your eyes. You still see the beautiful object, but now you have fully
understood and fully discerned the danger.

You have to know that poison is there, and you have to stop ignoring the
fact that poison is there---and then you get to see that whatever is
beautiful, you fully understood it as being dangerous, that 'this will
kill me'. But you can't see the poison and you can't extract it and then
say, "look, this is the poison! See?". Because that would then imply
that other things you can see don't have that poison. Poison is actually
in everything you see, hear, smell, taste, touch. Everything that's
agreeable contains that poison because it's agreeable. You could think
that the agreeability of things is what poison is. But that in itself is
not dangerous, is it? What's dangerous is you carelessly ingesting the
poison. You carelessly welcoming the agreeability, delighting in it,
saying 'yes' to it.

**Thaniyo:** So, the danger is not the result.

**Nyanamoli:** No, exactly. The danger is that significance of it. If
you take it, then danger befalls you.

**Thaniyo:** We'd usually think that danger of sensuality comes only if
you overindulge.

**Nyanamoli:** No, no, no, that's basically on the level of perception.
I suppose someone who's completely unrestrained has to start rounding it
up in such a crude manner.

Such kind of reflections that a complete assutava puthujjana will have
to go through in order to begin, but that's not the danger. That's why
the Buddha would say you're not free from sensuality until the danger
becomes apparent. And the danger does not become apparent if, for you,
to even get a sense of danger, you need to go through the motions of
repeating how dissatisfying sensuality actually is, and so on---that's
on the level of rationalizing.

It can help somebody who has absolutely no ground for practice, but you
want to go way beyond that---you want to be able to get to the point
where seeing the agreeable equals knowing the danger. That's why the
Buddha said knowledge is secondary to perception, but you can equally
have perception without knowledge being present there. So, knowledge is
not in perception, which means you can't perceive the knowledge, but you
can know that which you perceive at the same time.

In the case of a cup or drink in front of you---you're drinking it and
it's very good; people told you it's healthy. People told you it's going
to prolong your life and cure cancer, and it's amazing. But then
somebody comes and tel s you that it's actually going to kill you, going
to shorten your life. See, both could be right, meaning you don't know
which one is right; but the fact that it's been placed in doubt that
it's good for you is actually enough for you to back o from it. You
think that it is better not to take any chances. Perhaps you don't need
a longer life, because it might even actually shorten it. Let alone if
it actually becomes apparent that the second guy was right and it will
kill you quicker, it will ruin you. But that which is in front of you
hasn't changed---your experience of it is still the same.

**Thaniyo:** So, it might harm you.

**Nyanamoli:** The fact that you don't know for yourself whether it's
good for you---that's already dangerous. And if you start thinking like
that, the danger will become apparent---the danger that is actually
there---but you can't see that until you arrive at it, which means you
can't know that for yourself.

You have to take it on trust that sensuality is dangerous, and start
regarding it as such and, because it is dangerous, your way of regarding
it will eventually mirror how it is and you'll get to understand it.

And now, the peripheral of that perception of sensuality is the
knowledge of the danger. It's the significance of the danger, it's the
implication of the danger.

**Thaniyo:** But if you don't have the knowledge of the danger, what are
you looking for?

**Nyanamoli:** Well, first if you don't discern the phenomenon of
sensuality, you're not going discern the background of the danger. In
the same sense mindfulness of breathing is like a confinement that
represents all the other actions you do in your life on account of your
breathing, but then you're not doing that confinement. You want to
discern the background of that confinement. Then that makes everything
inferior to that even clearer. So, in the same sense, you want to
discern the extent of sensuality in order to discern the background of
the danger. That's why the Buddha would always start by saying: "The
gratification of sensuality has been understood, the danger has become
apparent." He wouldn't say that the danger has become apparent, and then
he understood. But by understanding the extent of sensuality, by
understanding its gratification, then the background of that, the
danger, becomes clear. But not before you understand the extent of
physical pleasures, craving for physical pleasures. And you can only
understand the extent if you start looking for it. And the gratification
of sensuality is not in the particular engagement of this sensuality,
it's in the background of your particular engagement.

There are obviously kinds of sensuality that you cannot be mindful
of---the ones that take the mind too far out, such as non-celibacy,
killing, lying, stealing. You abandon that; but now you have to eat.
Within that, you're going to get pleasant tastes in your mouth. And then
you might think: "Oh, I must spit this out because it's too pleasant."
In that case you don't see the gratification: you fear everything,
you're spitting out the object, but that's not what sensuality is.
Sensuality is your attitude in regard to the object you're attending to.
If all you do is attend to things, you're never going to see your
attitude in regard to it. Now that you live restrained, you're not
breaking vinaya rules, you see the danger in the slightest fault. Then
when you encounter agreeable things that are a basis for sensuality,
that's when you start looking for the background to it. You all ow it to
arise while the taste is in your mouth. The Buddha didn't say "spit out
the food!" But he said we should eat mindfully, meaning eat while you're
aware of the background of your pleasant taste. Don't get absorbed in
the pleasant taste. And try to not get absorbed by the pleasant taste by
focusing on other things, or twisting their tongue to avoid the taste
and whatnot. No, that's equally on the same footing as where the taste
is. You want to just know the background of the pleasant taste---that's
already clarifying the extent of gratification. The clearer the extent
of the perception of gratification becomes, the clearer the significance
of the danger. Hence, the gratification became clear, the danger has
been seen, has become apparent, and then the way out from sensuality and
gratification is automatic.

So, first, you have to be restrained, not giving in to distraction. If
you intentionally give in to sensuality, you can't establish that
mindfulness, because your intention has already distorted it---it's
already inverted, perverted. But if agreeable things that are a base for
sensuality come to you, without your intention necessarily being rooted
in seeking the pleasure in them, that's where you start discerning the
peripheral, that's where the gratification of sensuality becomes
clearer. That's why sila has to come first, it's just not optional. But
the problem is when people see that sila comes first and then believe
that after it comes the denial of anything pleasant, even if it's not
sought by you; that becomes the next attitude. They think: "This taste
is way too nice, so I only eat things that I hate." But you're basically
misconceiving sensuality. You think sensuality is in the actual taste,
and you think that by avoiding taste, you avoid sensuality. No, you just
obscure it further.

**Thaniyo:** If you were free from sensuality, you would be what?

**Nyanamoli:** You'd be an anagami. If you don't have the right view,
you could be free from sensuality and then you would need very, very
little instruction to get the right view because you've already done 80%
of the work: 80% of the fundamental existential distractions which are
the senses. That would have been tamed and surmounted and understood.

**Thaniyo:** Because if you see things, knowing that whatever has
arisen, the background is "it will cease," and then you turn your mind
to what is the extent of sensuality...

**Nyanamoli:** Exactly, you see the same principle. And also those who
don't see that principle, but have seen the sensuality, they have
removed pretty much the sole reason for not seeing impermanence.

Virtually, sensuality is the main reason because it results in
distraction and everything else. So, you have removed that, you have
understood that, you've developed your mind in regard to it. You have
seen the peripheral of that domain, you've seen the danger in it, and
then you just need somebody to tell you what the impermanence of
phenomena is, and you would immediately go straight to anagami, or even
arahant because you've already done all the work.

**Thaniyo:** So, you're saying that the danger of sensuality is being
pul ed in the foreground.

**Nyanamoli:** Yes. See, all that is accurate, but you want to see that
not as a statement that you made, but actually see it coming from that
sensuality. But in order to see it, you have to be clarifying that
understanding, even those statements, for yourself. The more you clarify
it, the more of the significance is being clarified. And then you will
get to recognize it. But the fundamental danger in sensuality is exactly
that: you cannot remain not pulled, not distorted by the foreground. You
cannot.

You're only free when you surmount the danger. You're only free when you
surmount ignorance. So, if you don't surmount it, you're not free. And
that's the danger of saṃsāra. Not free means saṃsāra.

**Thaniyo:** Am I not then seeing the danger in sensuality, if I see
that?

**Nyanamoli:** Well , you're seeing it to some extent, sure, but you
want to see that to the point where any desire toward it has faded
away---towards sensual enjoyment---, and it will fade away when the
perception of danger---that background implication, significance of
danger---is developed to the extent necessary, whereby no matter how
much you get distracted, you'll never, ever go back to the point of
being so distracted that you actually want sensuality.

In the same sense of when you vomit food that you ate, you'll never ever
get so hungry to eat that stuff that's mouldy and filthy and mixed with
soil. It's just not perceived as edible anymore. That's how far you want
to go. Where sensuality has ceased to be perceived as worthy of
engagement, where it's actually the opposite. Non-engagement is what's
worthy, non-engagement is what freedom is for you. Engagement is death
for you, results in death, implies death. It makes you liable to death.
Literally, you wouldn't be killed if somebody comes and shoots you in
the head. That's not death. Death is sending your mind back down to the
senses. That's how you get killed. Because if you take your mind away
from the senses---you surmount sensuality---even if somebody comes and
shoots you in the head, you are not killed. So that's why the Buddha
said that those who are not mindful---those who are not properly
established upon the peripheral background discernment of that
significance---they're as if already dead.

**Thaniyo:** Because if you see the extent of sensuality, then you know
very well when you step into it.

**Nyanamoli:** Yes, it cannot be done accidentally. It's always a
choice. If you're aware of the background, you're aware of being about
to make a choice. You're aware of the possibilities to choose, which
means you realize you're already responsible; you're already choosing
the direction of sensuality even before you directly engage with it.

**Thaniyo:** So, basically seeing the choice of sensuality is also
seeing the extent of sensuality.

**Nyanamoli:** Sure. Seeing the extent of sensuality, seeing the
background of sensuality. Discerning gradually the significance of it.
Taking responsibility for the choice. That's another approach to the
same thing.
