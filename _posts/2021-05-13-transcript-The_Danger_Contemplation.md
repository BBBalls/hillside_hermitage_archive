**Ajahn Nyanamoli:** In the context of the Noble Ones’ discipline, where
one possesses the Right view and has comprehended the Four Noble Truths,
it is crucial to regard every pleasure as a thorn. This means that, just
as one must be careful when entering a jungle filled with thorns, one
must exercise caution and attentiveness in approaching such experiences.
However, the emphasis lies not on learning “how” to be cautious, but on
cultivating the mindset of viewing pleasurable experiences as potential
dangers. By adopting this perspective, vigilance and care will arise
spontaneously, as one recognizes the potential harm that can arise from
delighting in pleasure. It is imperative to note that this simile is not
merely about physical caution, but about the mental attitude towards
pleasure and the hazards it presents.

Merely imitating carefulness methodically is insufficient to fulfill the
Noble discipline and attain Arahantship. One must learn to *view*
pleasurable experiences as thorns to genuinely grasp restraint and lack
of restraint. By adopting this mindset, certain perceptions develop that
aid in overcoming sensual desires and attachments. Understanding the
harm that pleasurable experiences pose leads to a natural sense of
vigilance and mindfulness. So, the effort one makes should not be
directed towards being mindful of every physical movement or similar.
Instead, one should strive to discern how to *perceive* sensuality as
“burning embers” and thus turn the sense restraint into something
effortless and preferable. This will be followed by dispassion and
freedom from suffering and attachment. The task entails thorough and
accurate reflection of recognizing the danger over and over again in
things that would otherwise be the foundation for desire.

In the first simile, the mind of a Noble disciple seeks to be anywhere
else in the world except in the burning pit. Similarly, when a
pleasurable experience arises in the mind, if one has cultivated the
perception of danger, one’s mind will not want to go there. Even when it
comes to eating, one should be attentive to how they perceive the food
and ensure that they do not lose their understanding of sensuality as
something perilous.

**Q:** Why am I unable to see the inherent danger in sensuality, even
though it is a fact? What is preventing me from recognizing the danger
that is present?

**Nm:** Although you can state that sensuality is dangerous, if you
still have passion towards it, then you have not truly understood its
danger. The measure of your understanding is whether or not you are
dispassionate in the face of sensuality. So, simply stating abstract
facts about the danger of sensuality is not enough, as it does not
reflect your actual experience. Don’t confuse abstract ideas for true
understanding. For example, simply acknowledging the “fact” of
impermanence of everything does not necessarily mean that you have any
*understanding* of it. To truly understand
<span lang="pi">*anicca*</span>, you must develop it to the point of
becoming a Sotapanna. Engaging with sensuality multiple times a day,
whether it be relishing, welcoming, planning, or worrying about it, is a
clear symptom of not having understood the danger of sensuality. Thus,
instead of taking it as a fact, contemplate the danger repeatedly for as
long as it takes for the context of its danger to become established.
And then protect the context by avoiding carelessness and indulging in
sensual thoughts.

**Q:** How can one identify or become aware of the danger?

**Nm:** Some individuals recognize the danger of excessive indulgence in
sensuality. They observe the discontent that arises from indulgence,
which is why many turn to religion, spirituality, and meditation. The
dissatisfaction is clear, and many people can perceive it. However, how
one responds to it determines if they remain trapped within the same
domain or if they free themselves from it.

For others, this might not be apparent at first, so they must take
refuge in the Buddha’s teachings and trust that sensuality is truly
dangerous and unworthy of attachment, even if it contradicts their
personal experiences. This requires a commitment to maintaining virtue
and practising sense restraint when agreeable sensations arise in the
body and mind. Trust in the teachings enables the mind to contemplate
and discern the danger of sensuality, which may not be immediately
apparent to its full extent.

By practising sense restraint and discerning the arising thoughts
without immediately acting upon them, one can gain insight into the
implications of sensuality and why it is not beneficial. Through
diligent contemplation and clarification, doubts can be endured and
overcome, and a deeper understanding of the danger of sensuality can be
realised.

It should be understood that simply hearing about the dangers of
sensuality is not enough. One must make a sincere effort to investigate
and reflect upon their own experiences with sensuality in order to truly
comprehend its harmful nature. Only then will the Buddha’s similes
regarding sensuality in the Suttas become clear and meaningful.

So, a genuine effort and personal investigation are necessary to truly
comprehend and avoid the danger of sensuality. The mere provision of
information without personal reflection and effort will not lead to
understanding and seeing of the danger.

**Q:** This is the simile of the deer herd that you often refer to:

<div lang="en">

> Bhikkhus, a deer-trapper does not lay down bait for a deer herd
> intending thus: ‘May the deer herd enjoy this bait that I have laid
> down and so be long-lived and handsome and endure for a long time.’ A
> deer-trapper lays down bait for a deer herd intending thus: ’The deer
> herd will eat food unwarily by going right in amongst the bait that I
> have laid down; by so doing they will become intoxicated; when they
> are intoxicated, they will fall into negligence; when they are
> negligent, I can do with them as I like on account of this bait.
>
> — <cite>MN 25</cite>

</div>

**Nm:** It cannot be denied that there is a pleasant quality to
indulging in the bait. However, it’s a trap. If one truly comprehends
this danger, the superficial allure of the bait will lose its power to
arouse desire.

**Q:** The bait is not intended for our well-being. The traps are not
set for our benefit.

**Nm:** As previously mentioned, it can be difficult to recognize the
potential danger within sensuality when it presents itself in a
beautiful and enticing manner. Our automatic response is to view it as
friendly, non- threatening, and harmless. However, it’s essential to
challenge this perception and ask ourselves why we view it as such. What
is the basis for our belief that pleasure of the senses is “natural” and
harmless? Have we ever truly questioned it, or is it simply an
assumption we’ve made without consideration?

If you fail to see sensuality as a problem, then no matter how much you
study the Buddha’s teachings, it will not make a difference. Sensuality
is a problem because you are under its control. If you ignore this fact,
you are like a prey caught in a trap, being dragged around by the hunter
while pretending to be going where you want to go. Meanwhile, the hunter
is there in your face, amused by your ignorance of the situation.

Sensuality, if it were wholesome, would not pressure you. It would not
require the loss of self-awareness, or induce lust in your mind.
Sensuality is deceptive and not what it appears to be. This is why the
Buddha often compared it to a trap.

**Q:**

<div lang="en">

> “Now the deer of the first herd ate food unwarily by going right in
> amongst the bait that the deer- trapper had laid down; by so doing
> they became intoxicated; when they were intoxicated, they fell into
> negligence; when they were negligent, the deer-trapper did with them
> as he liked on account of that bait. That is how the deer of the first
> herd failed to get free from the deer trapper’s power and control.”

</div>

**Nm:** They act impulsively and indulge in their desires, without any
consideration for the consequences or impact on themselves or others.
This is common behaviour.

**Q:**

<div lang="en">

> “Now the deer of a second herd reckoned thus: ‘The deer of that first
> herd, by acting as they did without precaution, failed to get free
> from the deer-trapper’s power and control. Suppose we altogether shun
> that bait food; shunning that fearful enjoyment, let us go out into
> the forest wilds and live there.’ And they did so. But in the last
> month of the hot season when the grass and the water were used up,
> their bodies were reduced to extreme emaciation; with that, they lost
> their strength and energy; when they had lost their strength and
> energy, they returned to that same bait that the deer-trapper had laid
> down. They ate food unwarily by going right in amongst it. By doing so
> they became intoxicated; when they were intoxicated they fell into
> negligence; when they were negligent, the deer-trapper did with them
> as he liked on account of that bait. And that is how the deer of the
> second herd also failed to get free from the deer-trapper’s power and
> control.”

</div>

**Nm:** This second type of individuals, even without the guidance of
the Buddha’s teaching, can still experience the dissatisfaction and
suffering caused by sensual desires and have enough intelligence to
recognize it. One doesn’t need to be a Buddhist to understand that these
desires are temporary, can only be appeased but never satisfied and they
control one’s life. Many people realise this and question the purpose of
pursuing these desires. Some of them choose to shun the bait, i.e. avoid
engaging with anything pleasing to the senses, such as beautiful sights,
sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. However, they fail to understand
the root of the problem - the attachment and craving in their minds -
and mistake the objects of pleasure as the source of the problem. Thus,
they become ascetics who deny any object that *could* be pleasing to the
senses. They think that by doing so, they can escape the suffering
caused by their own desires.

However, the problem with this approach is that pleasure or displeasure
is not determined by the objects themselves, but by one’s state of mind.
Even if one lives on top of a mountain, the mind can still crave for
pleasure and find it in previously unpleasant things. Therefore, one
cannot sustain the practice of not engaging with sense objects forever.
Sooner or later, one will encounter something pleasing, and if one
hasn’t understood the root of desire, one will be trapped by that.

This is similar to the second deer herd, which avoids the bait but
eventually returns to it when food becomes scarce in the mountains. When
they encounter the bait again, they get trapped because they haven’t
developed the wisdom to recognize where the *actual* trap is. They only
know how to run away from the bait, but not how to avoid discerning it
from the trap.

Doubling down on asceticism or creating elaborate ways to avoid
temptation, as the Jains did, will not solve the issue; as the root of
sensuality is not in the objects themselves, but rather in one’s
craving. The Buddha himself tried extreme asceticism to the point of
refusing to breathe or eat, but it did not free him from sensuality. He
realized that pain, and self-torture, were not the ways to
enlightenment.

Therefore, one should certainly exercise restraint and virtuous
behaviour; but then when thoughts of sensuality arise, it is important
to realise that not only should one not give into them, but neither
should one simply try to get rid of them. This is akin to avoiding
thinking about a trap without understanding how one is trapped. It is
through enduring these thoughts and understanding the pressure that
drives them that one can truly see its actual nature and overcome
sensuality. The Buddha emphasised that sensuality is not rooted in the
beautiful objects of the world, but rather in the desire and lust that
surrounds them. An Arahant or Tathagata who has removed desire and lust
from their thoughts can still perceive beautiful objects without being
driven by lust.

**Q:**

<div lang="en">

> “Now the deer of a third herd reckoned thus: ‘The deer of that first

> free from the deer-trapper’s power and control.”

</div>

**Nm:** This third deer herd is just like contemplatives who have
renounced indulgence in external sense objects and extreme ascetic
practices but have not abandoned their internal thirst for pleasure:
they act under the pressure of their views in which they find pleasure.
Although they may physically restrain themselves from indulging in
sensual pleasures, they still mentally entertain the same value of
pleasing objects and thirst for them. They may plan how to avoid
displeasing sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches, build their own
little palace, and avoid experiencing any hardship or elements. All of
these thoughts and actions show that they are still concerned about
catering to their senses for pleasure. Therefore, Mara, the trapper, may
still catch them because they left all the footprints around the bait.

The Buddha compares this to holding views or opinions that one feels
blindly justified about. Views can be anything from how monks should
wear their robes to what should be done or how one should behave. It is
not a choice to hold views, but it is a choice *what* views to hold and
how to hold them. If one feels ill will or irritation when someone
disagrees with their views, they are still holding onto views wrongly,
even if they are based on Dhamma.

A person holds the views “wrongly” through an emotional state that
underlies them. If one holds any view and feels emotionally disturbed
when someone challenges it, they are wrong to that extent. Even if the
view is accurate in and of itself. This means they have not removed the
passion internally and are not free from sensuality.

The problem lies in whether one is emotionally attached to one’s opinion
or not. So, instead of trying to rid oneself of views, one should learn
not to be moved by them. This way, one can objectively assess whether
their views are right or wrong without feeling existentially threatened
by opposing opinions. It is crucial to abandon wrong views and be
fearless in exploring and pushing in the very direction that one has
been afraid of. If one is upset by worldly views, how much more
emotional distress will they feel when they start undermining their very
personal existential views?

Any emotional attachment to a view, whether it is right or wrong, is
unjustifiable. If one finds oneself getting upset due to someone else’s
opinions or remarks, *that* makes them wrong. It does not matter if the
other person is foolish; it is irrelevant from a standpoint of the
Dhamma practice. Emotional involvement with any opinion or standpoint is
a sign of being wrong.

By not being emotionally invested in our views and standpoints, we can
avoid falling into the trap and thus become the fourth type of herd. The
Buddha had views and opinions on many things, but he did not have
passion underlying any of them. This is what we can strive for as well -
to have views and opinions but not be moved by them emotionally.

**Q:**

<div lang="en">

</div>

**Nm:** Individuals who are like the fourth type of deer herd do not
accept any external justification for their standpoints, which allows
them to become both externally and internally calmed. They do not act
out of craving and instead develop jhana, which is a place where Mara
cannot find them.
