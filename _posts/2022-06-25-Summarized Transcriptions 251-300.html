Factors of Enlightenment</h2>
<p>Sīlasutta SN 46.3:</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>…Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is accomplished in virtue, composure,
understanding, freedom, or the knowledge and vision of freedom, even the
sight of them is very helpful, I say. Even to hear them, approach them,
pay homage to them, recollect them, or go forth following them is very
helpful. Why is that? Because after hearing the teaching of such
bhikkhus, a bhikkhu will live withdrawn in both body and mind, as they
recollect and think about that teaching. At such a time, a bhikkhu is
cultivating the (1) awakening factor of recollection; they develop it
and perfect it…</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If you meet someone who has understood the
Dhamma, and then you contemplate that teaching, do you then have the
enlightenment factor of <em>Sati</em> - recollection?</p>
<p><strong>Ajahn Nyanamoli:</strong> Only if you are thinking about the
actual Dhamma. In other words, if you understood them correctly, then
yes. Thinking about the information that you have gathered about the
Dhamma is not an enlightenment factor; that’s not the same as
understanding the meaning, the core, of the Dhamma. If you understand
the Dhamma, then when you think about it, the enlightenment factors will
be brought to fulfillment. But, if you haven’t understood the Dhamma for
yourself, you can think about the Dhamma all you want—it won’t be on the
level of enlightenment factors, because it’s not on the level of
insight.</p>
<p>Before we get into the discussion, what are the enlightenment
factors?</p>
<p>Q: Recollection (<em>sati</em>), the investigation into dhammas
(<em>dhammavicaya</em>), effort (<em>viriya</em>), joy (<em>pīti</em>),
calm (<em>passaddhi</em>), composure (<em>samādhi</em>), and equanimity
(<em>upekkhā</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> That’s kind of the problem with most of the
things you read in the Suttas. It’s been so long since they were taught.
And, the only way to remember those things was through these linear
lists, like one, two, three, four, five, six, or seven of this, or eight
of that, and so on. That’s just mere information.</p>
<p>Somebody who is enlightened might not even know about enlightenment
factors in that order, in that list, in that particular way, the Buddha
taught on some occasion. That’s the important thing to realize if you
want to contemplate the enlightenment factors or the noble eightfold
path. It’s the same thing. It’s not one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, as the Suttas say. No, the right view comes first, and
then recollection through that is right and the direction of your
efforts is right, or your livelihood is right. It’s not like you develop
the right view, then go for the second step. It’s not a step-by-step
arrangement, and neither are the seven enlightenment factors.</p>
<p>One first needs to go and hear a Noble person’s teaching— understand
what they teach—and become a <em>sotāpanna</em>, and have the right view
developed. Then, based on that correct view and standpoint, think about
the Dhamma, and when it is recollected, those other enlightenment
factors will develop. That won’t happen by not having the right view and
just thinking about the list of enlightenment factors.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> So I shouldn’t think that if I do these seven
things, step by step, it will lead to enlightenment.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Exactly, thinking, “If I do step by step, these
seven things, it will culminate in complete enlightenment, but I have no
clue what that enlightenment is—I have no right view regarding the
escape from suffering and where the practice is. So, I’ll just basically
use the information that I have on the level of lists, collections,
steps and methods, and instructions. And, I’ll adhere to it with the
hope it will kind of bring me the result.” That won’t work.</p>
<p>You first need to understand those factors, then they will come to
fulfillment and development. Without understanding, without the right
view, there are no seven enlightenment factors in you. It doesn’t matter
how much you think about it. If on the other hand, you don’t think about
them as this methodical list, step by step instructions, but try to
understand their nature: What is correct recollection; What are the
correct investigations of phenomena; What is the correct effort; What is
<em>samādhi</em> as an enlightenment factor? and so on, then you can
eventually start to develop them.</p>
<p>There are many things that you need to develop beforehand. All of
that you can infer from reading the Sutta. So, have you developed all
these things beforehand? Have you truly developed the right view that
then makes you correctly recollected, that then makes you correctly
think about the dhammas, that then brings joy and calm, and so on? Or,
are you just fabricating joy or hoping for some calm as a kind of
magical result through some magical method or technique, so that you
don’t have to drill the work and go through the painful process of
trying to gain the understanding?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> These factors are factors of an awakened person,
and only the awakened person is developing these factors.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes, these are factors for somebody who has the
right view. Somebody who knows how to get to the result, how to fully
achieve enlightenment, but hasn’t done it yet. These factors are the
factors that he should dwell on and contemplate and they will come to
fulfillment if he just follows the direction of his own right view. The
usefulness of why the Buddha listed these seven factors for those who
have attained the right view but haven’t completed the work. It’s a good
reminder to them, “Look, there are these seven aspects of the same thing
that you already have, that you already understood, that already freed
you partially. So dwell on these seven aspects and they will in return
bring other aspects to fulfillment.”</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I remember first coming across these factors, and
trying to do them, sitting in meditation, watching the breath, and then
trying to look for them and thinking, “I’m making an effort. I’m
mindful. I’m investigating. I feel quite calm. I’m happy and I’m
peaceful….thus I am doing quite well. Nibbana is just around the
corner!”</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes. That is quite normal, especially due to the
whole <em>Abhidhamma</em>, where the whole Dhamma is presented as just a
basic collection of lists and a myriad of information and parallels, and
so on. But none of that is the Dhamma. Dhamma begins with the
understanding of the principle. If you don’t understand the principle of
freedom from suffering, as in the Four Noble Truths- as just one
principle with four aspects (If you fully understand it, you understood
the four facets of one insight.). Without that, there is no Dhamma, even
if you know all of the Suttas by heart and have collected a vast amount
of information. That’s something that people don’t necessarily know
because again, you’re presented with so much stuff today, and so many
different opinions. Then you come and read various things, and
naturally, try to make sense of them. But, you’re not aware that you’re
reading into it. You’re not transparent enough. You don’t have the right
basis. You don’t have the Gradual Training developed. So, when you come
across this information, it’s being misunderstood for
<em>understanding</em>. And, most people’s understanding is just that- a
collection of information. They have one piece of information and they
contrast it with another piece of information, and another piece of
information, and develop greater information, a nice spider diagram.
It’s a form of understanding, but it’s not a form of understanding that
pertains to that individual personal level—internally to be known by the
wise—as the Buddha says. Basically, the one that pertains to freedom
from suffering for which no amount of information will suffice to free
you—only that insight into the Four Noble Truths would.</p>
<p>That’s the important thing to realize, if you don’t have the right
view, your sole goal then is to develop the right view—insight into
freedom from suffering. To know for yourself suffering, the origin, the
cessation, and the path that leads to the cessation of suffering. When
that’s understood, then within that understanding you have the right
recollection, you have the noble eightfold path, you have the seven
enlightenment factors, you have the four right strivings, etc—whichever
aspect, it’s within that, and you will know that.</p>
<p>Now if you want to develop it more astutely, more precisely, and more
efficiently, you then study further the information about the seven
enlightenment factors, so that you can apply it correctly within that
basis that you have. But, if you don’t have a basis, it’s just a
collection of information.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Quite dangerous in a way.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Very dangerous, because the information is just
too easy to be misconceived, confused, mistaken for understanding. I
don’t want to make it sound like too much thinking or too much
information is bad. It’s dangerous, because of the wrong attitude
underneath, which means whether you have the information or not, the
wrong attitude is really what keeps you ignorant. So, don’t think now,
“I must not get all this information because it’s dangerous.” No, your
ignorance is dangerous, so you have to always keep perspective in regard
to that. “Ok, I am ignorant. And I’m collecting information now. I’m
learning about the Suttas. I’m not taking anything for granted. I’m
taking everything with a pinch of salt until I know for myself the way
out of suffering.”</p>
<p>Nothing shorter than <em>sotāpatti</em> should be a criterion of
success. If you don’t have that authentic attitude, then whether you
have a little bit of information or a lot of information, it makes no
difference because you’re already obscured by yourself, by being
ignorant, by not having that right attitude that pertains to freedom
from suffering as the only measure of understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> So, I’m now reluctant to even talk about this. To
provide further information about the enlightenment factors. I’ll just
continue:</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>…as they recollect and think about that teaching. At such a time, a
bhikkhu is developing the (1) awakening factor of <em>recollection</em>;
they develop it and perfect it. As they live recollected in this way
they investigate, explore, and inquire into that teaching with wisdom.
At such a time, a bhikkhu is developing the (2) awakening factor of
<em>investigation into dhammas</em> they develop and perfect it.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> All the enlightenment factors are peripheral and
secondary. By developing one thing, another thing gets developed in the
background. When he thinks and ponders about that teaching he
understood, <em>dhammavicaya</em> gets developed. Not - he thinks about
<em>dhammavicaya</em>, that’s how <em>dhammavicaya</em> gets developed.
He thinks about the Dhamma, ponders on Dhamma, or fortifies his
understanding of Dhamma, that effort is the development of
<em>dhammavicaya</em>, secondarily.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>…As they <em>investigate dhammas</em> with wisdom in this way their
effort is activated and tireless. At such a time, a bhikkhu is
developing the (3) awakening factor of effort; they develop it and
perfect it.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Such effort, again, is developed indirectly. He
is making the effort to clarify what he understands, to fortify, to
sustain, to protect that context—all that he invests into that brings
the enlightenment factor of effort to fulfillment. He’s striving towards
the goal of freedom from suffering that he understood but hasn’t fully
fortified. The direction of the right view, the understanding that you
get through the right view, and the effort you’re putting into
furthering that understanding, is the enlightenment factor of effort and
striving.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>…When they are striving, joy arises. At such a time, a bhikkhu is
developing the (4) awakening factor of joy; they develop it and perfect
it.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Joy arises on its own as a result, as a
byproduct of his striving. Not like, “Oh, let me just be joyful now,
because that’s another factor that the Buddha talks about.” No, follow
the direction of the right view. Don’t fall from it. Don’t neglect it.
Joy will then arise on account of the effort that you invested in
following that direction.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>…When the mind is full of joy, the body and mind become calm. At such
a time, a bhikkhu is developing the (5) awakening factor of calmness;
they develop it and perfect it. When the body is calm and one feels joy,
the mind becomes composed. At such a time, a bhikkhu is developing
the(6) awakening factor of composure; they develop it and perfect it.
They closely watch that peaceful mind with equanimity. At such a time, a
bhikkhu is developing the(7) awakening factor of equanimity; they
develop it and perfect it.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Again, that’s not something he does directly.
It’s done indirectly by fulfilling further the understanding of the four
noble truths. That’s how you will establish the right <em>samādhi</em>,
by being fully committed, directed, and composed in that one right way.
That’s one-pointedness—not one-pointedness of the tip of your nose, or
something. It’s one-pointedness of the direction towards freedom from
suffering—composed in that one direction. That’s the only meaning of the
<em>one-way-only</em> reference in the <em>satipaṭṭhānas</em>.</p>
<p>No right view equals no enlightenment factors, no <em>samādhi</em>,
no freedom from suffering, no understanding, no wisdom, and no
equanimity. If you think you have this <em>samādhi</em>, equanimity, and
this joy, without the right view—knowing that you don’t have a right
view—take those experiences with a pinch of salt. Recognize that they
might not be the correct <em>samādhi</em> and correct equanimity,
because there is no right view. It’s not to say, there is no
<em>form</em> of <em>samādhi</em> at all. But, it’s important to
recognize that there can be wrong <em>samādhi</em>—mistaken to be the
right <em>samādhi</em>—and that cannot magically become the right
<em>samādhi</em>.</p>
<p>Sometimes people might think, “Well, you know, I know my
<em>samādhi</em> is not right, but if I keep investing in the effort in
it, it will become right.” No, right <em>samādhi</em> is the result of
the right view and correctly directed mind. Right <em>samādhi</em> is
not the result of going along with the wrong <em>samādhi</em>. That’s
already the wrong view. Thinking you can directly develop
<em>samādhi</em> as a form of concentration that would then result in
some liberation. You develop the right <em>samādhi</em> by following the
right view, which is guided by the right recollection, and correct
investigation of dhammas, joy, calm, and effort, and that becomes a
unification of the mind. It’s equally secondary, the right
<em>samādhi</em>—it’s indirect. It’s a <em>peripheral</em> from where
you are making your effort towards understanding freedom from
suffering.</p>
<p>MN 117: ::: {.english} &gt;These three states run and circle the
right view: right view, right effort, and right recollection. :::</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> It’s always those three. If you have the right
view, it means there is a degree of right effort, and it certainly means
there is a degree of right recollection. If you have the right
recollection, the right view is there, and the right effort is there. If
you have the right effort, the right view is brought back, and the right
recollection is there. That’s what I mean by saying that “they’re not
linear”, and if you try to understand them on the level of their linear
information, you will fail, because they cannot be attended to directly
and be understood in their nature. You can attend to information
directly. “Okay, there’s one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.” But,
what does that information pertain to?—it pertains to understanding
freedom from suffering. What suffering?—well, suffering that I’m liable
to here and now.</p>
<p>So instead of me making the effort to draw connections and make
parallels that nobody else thought of, and somehow get a magical insight
on account of it, let me dwell on the level of my liability to
suffering—endure it, don’t try to get rid of it or manage it—which is
actually why a person would try to jump and pounce on the information
hoping it will bring them freedom. They are trying to get rid of that
liability that is painful.</p>
<p>The efforts to understand the Dhamma—if they’re directed towards
manipulating and drawing parallels between information that you
collected about the Dhamma—it’s just going to become another form of
management of your liability to suffering, not the uprooting of it.</p>
<p>Yes, you need the information. You need to be told what to do. If you
refuse to allow yourself to come back onto the level that it matters,
where that applies, you’re just going to stay on the level of playing
with information for the rest of your life, because you refuse to give
up the attitude of trying to manage your liability to suffering by
understanding information. That is psychotherapy; that is psychology;
that’s any kind of worldly way of dealing with suffering and pain—it’s
all on the level of management. It’s only relatively efficient. If you
learn the seven factors, you learn the four noble truths, you learn the
Gradual Training, and you have more information than you need. As we
said before, back in the Buddha’s day, there were no Sutta collections
as we have them now. All the information we have now on account of the
<em>nikāyas</em>, monks did not have access to that. Only Venerable
Ānanda remembered all of it. Most of the monks didn’t. Probably the vast
majority of them knew maybe one story, with one instruction, and that
was enough for enlightenment. Why? Because they did the work. If you
know the four noble truths and you know the Gradual Training—most
importantly—you know what comes first: the virtue, sense restraint,
guarding of the sense doors. You have all the information you need. Now
you have to start doing that. Which is what the information is telling
you to do. And, that’s the catch; people don’t do it. Even when they
take on the virtue, take on the gradual training, they still keep it on
the level of performing the instruction on the level of information,
because they don’t want to endure the <em>dukkha</em> on the right
level—that liability to suffering. They don’t want to feel it without
immediately trying to manage it, because it’s too unpleasant. You need
to give up the management, and just stay under the pressure of that
unresolved liability to suffering—on the deepest existential level so
that the right view can take root and start to grow. It can only do so
on that basis.</p>
<p>The Buddha taught only two things: suffering and freedom from it. If
somebody correctly understands the nature of <em>dukkha</em>, there are
only two outcomes of that, either mental derangement or noble search. If
they don’t lose their mind on account of the recognition of that
liability to suffering, that existential dread, then they will have no
other choice but to try and correctly uproot it, and seek the correct
information—that will then be the basis for them making the right effort
and enduring things on the right level. It comes down to that, enduring
things on the right level. If you endure things on the level of that
existential <em>dukkha</em>—without trying to manage it, get rid of it,
distract yourself from it— then the whole basis for the right view and
everything else that comes from it is being developed. That’s the
fundamental difference between information and understanding it. It’s in
two opposite directions. Information gives you something that needs to
be understood, but only your effort to understand can bring that
understanding—not more information. More information cannot accidentally
result in understanding—only your effort to understand.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter how much information you have, and how dependent
you became on that information. All of that can be cleaned away in one
sweep of just re-establishing yourself, if you’re brave enough and
strong enough to endure it on the level of, “I am still liable to
sickness, aging death, anxiety, dread, suffering. I know no escape from
it internally. I am not able to not move when these things present
themselves, which is why I always try to avoid those things from
presenting themselves. I always try to cover up when they’re
present—with the possibility of their presence. I always try to ignore
and distract myself from it.” If you abandon these attitudes and endure
these things on the right level, even the little information you
collected will start slotting itself in the right place, because now you
got the right basis. That’s why the two factors for the right view are
correct information (utterance of another), and the
<em>yonisomanasikāra</em>—without which, there is no right view. Even if
you listen to the Buddha himself giving you the information.</p>

Only The Noble Truth Of Pain</h2>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The four noble truths, you’re saying, are four
aspects to one insight.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> The insight being the way out of suffering. You
see how to escape from it without trying to get rid of it. If you want
to understand the way out of suffering, first you need to understand the
suffering, and you can’t understand the suffering if you can’t give up
the pressure, the need, the urge, the craving to get rid of it, to
manage it, to prevent it. You need to endure and not act out of the
pressure towards more pleasure when you’re feeling agreeable. You need
to endure and not act out of the pressure towards getting rid of the
pain when you’re feeling disagreeable. You need to endure and not act
out of the pressure to ignore the neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant
feeling. That type of endurance is the hardest thing to do.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Patient endurance is the supreme austerity. Khantī paramaṃ tapo
titikkhā.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>– <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dhp179-196">Dhp 179-196</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s why people find sense-restraint difficult because you have to
endure that pressure of craving. That’s why they find it difficult to
NOT try and manage their suffering, but instead explain it or
psychologize it, because that endurance is very difficult. That’s why
people find it really hard to not distract themselves when they’re
feeling neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant, to not find something to do, to
not find an activity to keep them occupied, because it just becomes too
unpleasant.</p>
<p>If you endure things on the level of not acting out of craving
towards whatever is felt or out of unwholesome intentions, you are
practising the highest of all ascetic practices, and the only one that
matters. That is the endurance that results in the uprooting of craving
and the cessation of dukkha.</p>
<p>If you endure things on that right level, you will not need much of
an instruction because you already have the right basis, which can lead
to the obvious aspects of your situation being revealed, such as, “Okay,
so I am liable to suffering and everything I’ve been doing so far, has
not uprooted it, has not even been in the direction of uprooting that
suffering, it was all only on the level of management and distraction
from it, and the Dhamma is the direction of uprooting, so it’s
completely the opposite direction in which I have been going so far.”
But for that insight to arise, you first need to endure things on the
right level.</p>
<p>You have to understand the suffering first, in order to see the way
out. In order for you to understand suffering, you need to stop trying
to get rid of it and trying to manage the suffering. You need to allow
it to be, to endure, because it takes time to understand it. By covering
up the suffering, by trying to get rid of it, by trying to manage it,
you are not uprooting it, if you were, it would not return.</p>
<p>Can you endure the pain without expressing it, without trying to
repress it or trying to get rid of it, without psychologizing it,
without hateful thoughts, without turning away and ignoring it? Can you
just stay with it?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I endure my liability to suffer without doing
anything on account of it? I could say, “Ok, I am now going to endure
the suffering so that I can get rid of it!”</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> So, you started enduring the suffering, maybe
for one second, in the right way? And then the next second, you fall
into, “Now I’m enduring it because I want to get rid of it”. So what do
you do then? Well, you include that into your endurance of suffering
that you don’t want to get rid of.</p>
<p>You can endure the suffering, rightly, but then you can endure it
wrongly if you become motivated by different reasons, such as, you’re
not enduring it for its own sake, you’re doing it to get rid of it,
which means that you have just returned to the old attitude. So how do
you stop that? By enduring it, it’s not going to be perfect but for as
long as you know that you are supposed to endure it without acting out
of it, then even that mind that makes that ‘endurance’ as an act of
craving, will calm down if you endure it sufficiently enough without
turning away.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong></p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“...This is the dukkha ariya·sacca/noble truth of suffering:\ 1-
jāti/birth is dukkha,\ 2-jarā/decaying is dukkha,\ 3-maraṇa/death is
dukkha,\ 4-association with the disliked is dukkha,\ 5-separation from
the liked is dukkha,\ 6-not getting what one wants is dukkha;\ 7-in
short, the pañcupādānakkhandhā/ five assumed aggregates are dukkha…”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Basically, your life is the basis for your
dukkha. That’s it. It’s not like particular things are the basis for
your dukkha, the ‘five aggregates’ are the basis for the dukkha. In
other words, you haven’t done anything wrong, you were just born. Birth
is dukkha, that’s it. Even if you don’t do anything particularly wrong,
you’re already affected with dukkha because you’re already here.
Everything else that comes throughout your life is kind of a secondary
reminder of what the dukkha already is and that you are already liable
to it. That’s why a person needs to develop the state of mind that
recognises this and restrains themselves from trying to address those
myriad of individual instances of suffering, “Oh, he said, that upset
me, she didn’t do that which upset me, I’ll go talk to her, I’ll tell
him off,….all so that I can address the suffering”.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“He abused me, he attacked me, he defeated me, he robbed me.” Those
who harbour such thoughts will never end their hatred.\ “He abused me,
he attacked me, he defeated me, he robbed me.” Those who do not harbour
such thoughts will end their hatred.\ Hatred never ends through hatred;
by non-hatred alone does it end. This is an eternal truth.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>– <a href="https://suttafriends.org/sutta/dhp1/">Dhp 1 Yamaka
Vagga</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of these things that you experienced throughout the life that
involved suffering are not the reason for your suffering, if they were,
freedom from suffering would not be possible. It’s your craving in
regard to how you feel on account of these things in the world, that’s
the root of suffering. For as long as you keep acting out towards him or
her or this or that, or particular instances of suffering, you’re not
allowing yourself to see it on the right level, which means you cannot
address it correctly. You’re still blaming the individual
circumstances.</p>
<p>A view needs to be developed, whereby you recognise that it’s not
about instances of suffering, it’s about the fact that you are liable to
suffer. That’s it. If it’s not this instance that you suffer in regard
to, it would have been something else and it will be something else.
You, trying to manage and perfect your ways of managing your
environment, the way you speak to people, the way they speak to you, all
of that is basically rooted in the fact that you know deep down, that
you don’t know the escape from suffering, and you just want to minimise
the pain, you want to manage it. And for as long as you value that
management, you will not force yourself to look for the direction of
uprooting suffering. That’s the trap of thinking, “Oh, this management
technique is helpful. My psychotherapy is helpful, psychology is
helpful, watching my breath is helpful, etc…”. All these management’s
are helpful to manage your pain, but if you become dependent on
management of the symptoms, you are not going to be able to endure the
symptoms so to reveal the source of your illness, because you
immediately cover up the symptoms, you manage it, you take a pill, you
deal with the symptoms, and they’re gone and now you don’t see the
illness and think that ‘you suffering less than you used to’ means that
the illness is ending, yet you are still as liable to dukkha as before,
that hasn’t changed.</p>
<p>You need to endure the symptom by resisting the pressure to manage it
and by not managing the discomfort, you get to understand, “Right, now
it’s this that I’m suffering over, yesterday was something else,
tomorrow it will be something else, the point is, I am liable to
suffering and even if I perfectly address this and that issue, I cannot
prevent circumstances from making me uncomfortable in the future and
that’s the problem.” You can realise that it’s not about particular
sufferings, it’s about the nature of suffering.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I am infected by craving and affected by feeling.
I am thus liable to suffering.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> These particular instances of affections are
just the reminders of your situation that’s already within that
liability. Birth, as in manifestation, is already suffering, you are
manifested from the moment you’re born. For as long as your
manifestation is here, dukkha is here. That’s it. Even if you don’t
experience anything uncomfortable, no incidents, you are still within
dukkha, you are still liable. That’s why a person doesn’t need great
misfortunes and so on to recognise the nature of their situation, “I am
liable to suffer”.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I’m affected by things. Things happen. I feel
them.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> You feel them either pleasant, unpleasant or
neutral. Which means at any given time, there is some pressure placed on
you. Even though you might say, “Oh, see now it’s all fine. I’m not
affected by suffering.” , but just ask yourself, “Am I feeling
something? Yes”, Well, to that extent, suffering is implicit, you are
pressured to that extent. You are liable to feelings. Can you even
conceive being in control of your feelings? Saying I should feel this
and I should not feel that? No, that’s only on the level of wishful
thinking. Liability to feelings means liability to suffering. You have
no say in what feeling arises and how long it persists. You know that
they change. For example, you might have a pleasant feeling, you had it
so many times before, but you also know that it has to cease at some
point, which means, if you’re honest with yourself, that through a mere
change of feeling, whatever feeling is there, you will have to
experience suffering to some extent.</p>
<p>Are you able then to not be pressured by anything that you feel at
any given time? Even pleasure pressures you. It makes you nervous, “What
if I lose this? What if it doesn’t last long enough? I want more of it?
How to protect it? How do I get it again?” That’s not actually a
peaceful state. Pain, obviously it’s not a peaceful state either, and in
terms of neutral feeling, one thinks that it’s boring, which is very
much not peaceful, although it’s peaceful, there’s nothing happening.
Yet, nothing happening is the most frightening thing for the ignorant
mind.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> There are just three types of feeling, just three
types of pain.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Well, three types of feeling means one type of
pain, one dukkha. As it says in the Suttas, “Whatever is felt counts as
suffering in the discipline of the noble one.” If you have the right
view, if you understand the nature of feelings, you understand that
whatever is felt is unpleasant because it’s felt.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“..Good, good, bhikkhu! These three feelings have been spoken of by
me: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, neither-painful-nor-pleasant
feeling. These three feelings have been spoken of by me. And I have also
said: ‘Whatever is felt is included in suffering.’ That has been stated
by me with reference to the impermanence of sankharas. That has been
stated by me with reference to sankharas being subject to destruction …
to sankharas being subject to vanishing … to sankharas being subject to
fading away … to sankharas being subject to cessation … to sankharas
being subject to change…”</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> If you feel, that means you are affected, and
therefore you can know that you are infected, you have a disease.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Exactly. Feeling is a symptom of an underlying
problem. You’re subjected to and imprisoned by, trapped within a
disease. But if you don’t see that as a symptom, as I said, if you still
feel justified and have the view that management of suffering,
management of symptoms, doing something about it so to overcome it when
it arises, if you don’t abandon that view, and if you don’t restrain
yourself, you’re not going to see how deep the illness goes. Which means
you’re not going to see the source of it.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If I am aware of feeling, I am aware of
dukkha.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> If you’re aware of feeling correctly. What is
the feeling? Most people would, through those views of management,
proliferation and confusing information for understanding, would think
that feelings are physical sensations that they have in their body. No,
feeling is a state of mind, feeling is always mental. Feelings in regard
to the body are always mental. And there’s only three types of feeling
on that level, which is the level of feeling agreeable, disagreeable,
and neither-agreeable-or-disagreeable.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“…It’s for one who feels that I declare: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This
is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ …
‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering…’.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong></p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“This is the dukkha·samudaya ariya·sacca/the noble truth of the
origin of suffering:\ 1-Taṇhā/urge/inclination/craving,\ 2-which
perpetuates being,\ 3-connected with craving and passion,\ 4-finding
delight here or there,\ 5-that is to say: kāma-taṇhā/sensual desire,
bhava-taṇhā/desire for being and vibhava-taṇhā/desire for
non-being.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> That brings us to the point I’ve already said,
the origin, the source, the basis, the necessary condition for presence
of dukkha is presence of craving. It’s not what you’ve seen, smelt,
tasted, touched, thought about, remembered, etc. It’s about craving
towards whatever is felt there and then, that’s the root of dukkha. The
world or samsara is not the dukkha. It’s not the cause of suffering.
It’s your attitude, on that emotional level, towards samsara, that’s
what suffering is. It’s your craving towards it. What craving? Craving
for more pleasure in pleasant feeling, craving for less pain in a
painful feeling, craving for ignorance and distraction in a neutral
feeling. That’s it, that’s the root of the entire universe of suffering.
But in order to get to the root, you need to stop acting out of that
craving, which is trying to manage your suffering.</p>
<p>The gradual training, the prerequisites in the form of a lifestyle
that the Buddha outlined, is the way of rounding up, towards the centre
of that suffering, which is your craving, which is an internal thing.
However, if your lifestyle still revolves around the pursuit of sense
pleasures, management of your suffering, trying to get rid of pain,
acting out of pain through unwholesome acts of anger, distracting
activities, avoidance of boredom and solitude, etc. There’s no way
you’re going to uproot craving, when you’re still physically, still
passionately engaged in maintaining it. First, you need to physically
stop acting out of it, then verbally, then mentally, then you can
eventually see the roots, see your own attitude towards what’s currently
felt.</p>
<p>You want to act out of craving because you feel confined within it.
You can escape from that confinement by giving up sensuality, when it’s
pleasant, by giving up management of pain when it’s unpleasant, and by
giving up distraction and indolence when it’s neutral. That will reveal
your confining situation and the fundamental resistance you have towards
the senses that we spoke of before. And if you continue not to act out
of craving, the mind will calm down within that and then you get to see
the escape.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Near Sāvatthī. As he was standing to one side, Pañcālacaṇḍa the
deva’s son recited this verse in the Blessed One’s presence:”Truly in a
confining place, he found an opening—the one of extensive wisdom, the
awakened one who awakened to jhāna, the chief bull, withdrawn, the
sage.”</p>
<p>The Buddha:“Even in a confining place they find it, the Dhamma for
the attainment of Nibbana. Those who have gained recollection, are
rightly composed.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>– <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn2.7">SN 2.7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s wisdom, it’s not a magical result of some method or some
accidental insight. When you get to see dukkha for what it is through
your act of non-craving, then that craving, that dukkha will begin to
evaporate because it requires you to ignore it for its maintenance. You
remove it indirectly by not providing a basis for craving to grow and
then it will dry up.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong></p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>This is the dukkha·nirodha ariya·sacca/the noble truth of the
cessation of suffering:\ 1-the complete virāga/dispassion,\
2-nirodha/cessation,\ 3-cāgo/abandoning,\ 4-paṭinissaggo/giving up,\
5-mutti/release and\ 6-anālayo/detachment from that very taṇhā.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Cessation of craving means cessation of the
possibility to suffer on account of anything, that the senses, the
aggregates, the world brings you, good or bad, doesn’t matter. You
cannot suffer because you cannot crave.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong></p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>This is the dukkha·nirodha·gāminī paṭipada ariya·sacca/ the noble

1-sammā·diṭṭhi/right view,\ 2-sammā·saṅkappa/right resolve,\
3-sammā·vācā/right speech,\ 4-sammā·kammanta/right action,\
5-sammā·ājīva/right livelihood,\ 6-sammā·vāyāma/right effort,\
7-sammā·sati/ right recollection,\ 8-sammā·samādhi/ right composure.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> The right view comes first. You need to know,
“The root of the craving is not in the world. It’s not due to
insufficient management or not having a perfect meditation technique or
something else. It’s in the craving towards what I’m feeling, nothing
else.” Therefore, you first need to stop acting out of craving, and then
your resolves, your speech, actions, livelihood and efforts need to
start matching that principle. That’s the noble eightfold path.</p>
<p>Then in the pleasure, there will just be the pleasure, there will be
no more implicit craving for wanting more of it. There’s nothing more
there’s nothing less because you’re not resisting it, nor leaning
towards it. It’s not touching you, it’s not yours anymore, which means
it’s not pressuring you. There’s nothing wanted in regard to it and
nothing not wanted in regard to it either. Not touching or being touched
by it, it is no longer felt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…Ven. Udayin said to Ven. Sariputta,”But what is the pleasure here,
my friend, where there is nothing felt?”</p>
<p>“Just that is the pleasure here, my friend: where there is nothing
felt…”</p>

Simile of The Son’s Flesh</h2>
<p>SN 12.63 Puttamansa Sutta: A Son’s Flesh:</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“At Savatthi…”There are these four nutriments for the maintenance of
beings who have come into being or for the support of those in search of
a place to be born. Which four? Physical food, gross or refined; contact
as the second, mental intention the third, and consciousness the fourth.
These are the four nutriments for the maintenance of beings who have
come into being or for the support of those in search of a place to be
born.</p>
<p>“And how is physical food to be regarded? Suppose a couple, husband
&amp; wife, taking a few provisions, were to travel through a desert.
With them would be their only dear baby son. Then the few provisions of
the couple going through the desert would be used up while there was
still a stretch of the desert yet to be crossed. The thought would occur
to them, ‘Our few provisions are used up while there is still a stretch
of this desert yet to be crossed. What if we were to kill our only dear
baby son, and make dried meat. That way, chewing on the flesh of our
son, at least the two of us would make it through this desert.
Otherwise, all three of us would perish.’ So they would kill their only
dear baby son, and make dried meat. Chewing on the flesh of their son,
they would make it through the desert. While eating the flesh of their
only son, they would beat their breasts, crying, ‘Where have you gone,
our only dear baby son? Where have you gone, our only dear baby son?’
Now what do you think, monks: Would that couple eat that food playfully
or for intoxication, or for putting on bulk, or for beautification?”</p>
<p>“No, lord.”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t they eat that food simply for the sake of making it through
that desert?”</p>
<p>“Yes, lord.”</p>
<p>“In the same way, I tell you, is the nutriment of physical food to be
regarded. When physical food is understood, passion for the five cords
of sensual pleasures is understood. When passion for the five cords of
sensual pleasure is understood, there is no fetter bound by which a
disciple of the noble ones would come back again to this world.</p>
<p>“And how is the nutriment of contact to be regarded? Suppose a flayed
cow were to stand leaning against a wall. The creatures living in the
wall would chew on it. If it were to stand leaning against a tree, the
creatures living in the tree would chew on it. If it were to stand
exposed to water, the creatures living in the water would chew on it. If
it were to stand exposed to the air, the creatures living in the air
would chew on it. For wherever the flayed cow were to stand exposed, the
creatures living there would chew on it. In the same way, I tell you, is
the nutriment of contact to be regarded. When the nutriment of contact
is understood, the three feelings, pleasure, pain,
neither-pleasure-nor-pain are understood. When the three feelings are
understood, I tell you, there is nothing further for a disciple of the
noble ones to do.</p>
<p>“And how is the nutriment of mental intention to be regarded? Suppose
there were a pit of glowing embers, deeper than a man’s height, full of
embers that were neither flaming nor smoking, and a man were to come
along, loving life, hating death, loving pleasure, resisting pain, and
two strong men, having grabbed him by the arms, were to drag him to the
pit of embers. To get far away would be that man’s intention, far away
would be his wish, far away would be his aspiration. Why is that?
Because he would realize, ‘If I fall into this pit of glowing embers, I
will meet with death from that cause, or with death-like pain.’ In the
same way, I tell you, is the nutriment of mental intention to be
regarded. When the nutriment of mental intention is understood, the
three forms of craving for sensual pleasures, craving for being, and
craving for non-being are understood. When the three forms of craving
are understood, I tell you, there is nothing further for a disciple of
the noble ones to do.</p>
<p>“And how is the nutriment of consciousness to be regarded? Suppose
that, having arrested a thief, a criminal, they were to show him to the
king: ‘This is a thief, a criminal for you, your majesty. Impose on him
whatever punishment you like.’ So the king would say, ‘Go, men, and
shoot him in the morning with a hundred spears.’ So they would shoot him
in the morning with a hundred spears. Then the king would say at noon,
‘Men, how is that man?’ ‘Still alive, your majesty.’ So the king would
say, ‘Go, men, and shoot him at noon with a hundred spears.’ So they
would shoot him at noon with a hundred spears. Then the king would say
in the evening, ‘Men, how is that man?’ ‘Still alive, your majesty.’ So
the king would say, ‘Go, men, and shoot him in the evening with a
hundred spears.’ So they would shoot him in the evening with a hundred
spears. Now what do you think, monks: Would that man, being shot with
three hundred spears a day, experience pain and distress from that
cause?”</p>
<p>“Even if he were to be shot with only one spear, lord, he would
experience pain and distress from that cause, to say nothing of three
hundred spears.”</p>
<p>“In the same way, I tell you, monks, is the nutriment of
consciousness to be regarded. When the nutriment of consciousness is
understood, name&amp;form are understood. When name&amp;form are
understood, I tell you, there is nothing further for a disciple of the
noble ones to do.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How to develop complete dispassion towards
food?</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> By developing that context that the “son’s flesh
simile” outlined. That will prevent you from having any passion towards
food. The simile is not just some shocking poetry. No, imagine eating
your own child, how would that feel while you are trying to survive? Now
take that context and apply to any food you eat. That’s how it should
feel, that’s the context that you need to sustain. Why? Because the mind
will completely turn away from any enjoyment, amusement and any lust
towards edible food, edible nutriment, which in return will completely
remove any attachment and desire towards the five cords of sensual
pleasure because that’s what it all comes down to, your consumption of
pleasure.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t be lost in your consumption of food, you would eat only
to the point of overcoming hunger for survival. You wouldn’t eat for the
sake of eating, for the sake of chewing, for the sake of enjoying, you
would only have one goal in your mind. So whenever you eat, always bring
that context up, even before you start eating, bring that context up,
and then you’ll see whether you need to eat and how much to eat, and if
there is any passion towards what you’re eating. There won’t be passion
there if you sustain this context because it cannot survive in that
environment.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe their child tasted very nice, in terms of the actual
taste, but it doesn’t mean that at any given time, mother and father who
loved their child, could have enjoyed it. So it’s not that the mouth
won’t perceive agreeability of texture and taste, but in any case,
that’s not the basis for passion. Loss of context is the basis for
passion for agreeability of taste.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Should I be concerned about how I’m eating?</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> No, I wouldn’t worry about the way you’re
eating. If the context is there, it doesn’t matter which way you’re
eating.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Would it be useful to try to think about the
process of the consumption, like, thinking the food is going inside the
body and not going inside ‘Me’, or it’s for the body which isn’t “mine”,
and it’s not for my enjoyment and so on?</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> All of that is kind of psychologizing. All of
those “insights” and the way you can describe it are fine, if the
context is there. The context of eating for the right reason only, not
too much, not too little, not overthinking it, certainly not giving in
to the enjoyment, craving and emotional dependence on agreeable food.
But if that context is not there, then, you can analyse it, visualise it
in certain ways, and you can contemplate how it’s just going into the
body which is not yours, etc, but fundamentally, the passion is still
there. So that’s why the Buddha gave such a drastic simile. All those
kinds of thoughts that you try to use when eating, although true, won’t
work, because the lust is rooted deeper than that. What will work is
when you don’t want to eat it, but you have to and what will work even
more when you don’t want to eat it, but you have to and what you have to
eat is what is dearest to you. It’s not meant to be eaten, so then there
will not be even a grain of your being that would want to be eating it,
you will only eat to survive. Purely. Same with the simile of the
charcoal pit and burning embers, if two men come and drag you towards
that pit, your mind would want to be anywhere else except there.
Intention would go in any direction except to the pit.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why can’t I just enjoy my food? Why can’t I just
eat it?</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Because it doesn’t belong to you. Your body
doesn’t belong to you. So how can you eat the food as if it’s yours? You
can enjoy it if you want. It’s not like you cannot. Yes, you can. But
then you have to suffer the consequences. In the same sense a fish
suffers consequences when he eats the food that a fisherman puts on a
hook. The fish enjoys it and as a result of that gets hooked. So it’s
not that we are outlining some moral law here that you must hate your
food and eat it like it’s your only child. Do what you like, eat and
enjoy if you want to.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> But what’s the danger?</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Well, exactly. You already know that there is
some danger, that’s the point. Why do people not like to think about the
illness, their own illness or even illness of people that are dear to
them? Mortality? Ageing,? Why is that? There must be something there
that people don’t want to admit. Well, chasing pleasure of food or
otherwise is tied to that. So if you stop and think about it, you would
see that maybe, “I could enjoy food, I could enjoy the senses. But what
if there is a catch there?” And again, even the most untrained mind can
see, even if you don’t know anything about the Dhamma, no values of
precepts or whatever else, everybody at some point in their life, sooner
or later, thinks, “What’s the point in chasing sensual desires, food or
otherwise, when it only results in a very, very temporary
satisfaction?”</p>
<p>The point is, you already have an inkling that, “Oh, so there is no
end to this. And I’m kind of enslaved by it. And that’s not a good
position to be in. But hey, I’ll forget about that because I’ll chase
the next desire, and next desire and next desire.” And that’s how people
go through life. So yes, you can do that. But again, there are
consequences that you will have to pay the price for. Price of eating,
consuming and taking all these things up, that don’t belong to you. Then
at the end, the bill comes and you realise, “Oh, now I have to pay for
all of that. I thought it was mine. I thought I was the owner. I thought
it was free.” But it’s not. If it were free, it wouldn’t be pressuring
you so much. It wouldn’t be enticing you so much. It wouldn’t be
trapping you so much, it wouldn’t be baiting you so much. There’s always
a catch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When lust for the five types of sensual pleasure is fully understood

</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Fully understanding lust and assumptions in
regard to the solid food, you will fully understand and remove the
ownership of the physical body that depends on the solid food, it won’t

sensual pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong></p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“And how is the nutriment of <em>phassa</em>/contact/pressure to be
regarded? Suppose a flayed cow were to stand leaning against a wall. The
creatures living in the wall would chew on it. If it were to stand
leaning against a tree, the creatures living in the tree would chew on
it. If it were to stand exposed to water, the creatures living in the
water would chew on it. If it were to stand exposed to the air, the
creatures living in the air would chew on it. For wherever the flayed
cow were to stand exposed, the creatures living there would chew on it.
In the same way, I tell you, is the nutriment of contact/pressure to be
regarded. When the nutriment of contact/pressure is understood, the
three feelings ,pleasure, pain, neither-pleasure-nor-pain are
understood. When the three feelings are understood, I tell you, there is
nothing further for a disciple of the noble ones to do.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> That’s why I like to translate
<em>phassa</em>/contact as pressure. It’s not an impersonal, mechanical
or biological “contact”. It’s the mental pressure. <em>Phassa</em> is
the pressure to act on account of what is felt, and that’s exactly how
the cow is feeling. It’s not just nonchalant about creatures
anatomically chewing on its flesh. No, it’s pressured, it’s harassed,
it’s annoyed. It’s attacked, it’s being devoured, it’s uncomfortable.
“Contact” is uncomfortable. So do you regard <em>phassa</em> as
uncomfortable or do you not even see it as a pressure at all? If that’s
the case, your understanding of or your idea of <em>phassa</em> is very
inaccurate. And usually it’s very inaccurate. People usually think, due
to the whole commentarial misrepresentation which explains
<em>phassa</em> as a physical coming together of the senses, sense
objects and consciousness, and then ‘poof!’, the result of that is
sight, sound,etc. As if it has nothing to do with me, and I’m not
responsible for it. No, <em>phassa</em> is indeed having eyes and
sights, but it’s being pressured on account of what is felt in regard to
that. That’s where <em>phassa</em> is.</p>
<p>So in other words, if people want to understand <em>phassa</em>, if
they want to understand the situation of that cow, then find things
within your mind, where you are emotionally pressured, on account of
anything, sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, thought, doesn’t matter. If
there is pressure there, if there is discomfort there, that’s where
<em>phassa</em> is. And that’s what needs to be understood, not
psychologically or anatomically explained in terms of sense organs and
so on. That’s not the <em>phassa</em>.</p>
<p>Imagine the cow being devoured by the insects, and you’re telling it,
“Oh, no, see, this is what’s happening to you. In dependence on the body
and bodily-touches, body-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three
is contact. With contact as condition, feeling.”, “Okay, yeah, but I’m
still pressured, I still suffer. So that knowledge of the explanation of
the contact is not freeing me from this discomfort. Thus, it’s not the
knowledge because if that knowledge truly pertains to the nature of that
phenomenon, it will result in freedom from suffering, as the suttas
would say.” The full understanding of contact results in you being free
from the pressure.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion
towards the body, towards bodily phenomena, towards body-consciousness,
towards body-contact, towards feeling. Experiencing revulsion, he
becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion the mind is liberated. With
its deliverance he understands: ’Assumption has been fully understood by
me.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Q:</strong></p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“When the nutriment of contact/pressure is understood, the three
feelings, pleasure, pain, neither-pleasure-nor-pain are understood.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Exactly, because that’s where the pressure is,
it’s where the feeling is. Fully understanding the nature of pressure,
you have fully uprooted any resistance or welcoming towards respective
feelings. In other words, you’re completely free from craving.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Through understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes, by understanding the pressure in regard to
the currently enduring feeling, not by explaining it. But by
understanding its nature, that will result in complete freedom from
it.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I can reflect on how I am subjected to
feelings…</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes, you could, but first, you need to feel the
pressure. You can start these abstract questionings and self
interrogations, but you first need to feel the pressure on account of
whatever feeling is present there, because it’s there. Some pressure
always has to be there, you can’t be in-between the pressures. No,
there’s always something felt, which means there’s always something
pressuring you, big or small, doesn’t matter, pressure is there. So,
first, you need to stop acting out of that pressure habitually. Then
allow the feeling to endure, then the phenomenon of pressure that
manifests in regard to that, you can start interrogating its properties,
and you can realise that in itself, the “pressure to act” is enough “in
itself” it does not imply any action.</p>
<p>For example, an itch does not imply a scratch, you assume a scratch
because you don’t want the itch. You assume the ‘act out of pressure to
relieve the pressure’ because you don’t want the pressure. However, if
you remove the gratuitous resistance to the pressure in itself, pressure
is just the pressure, thus, it’s not pressuring you anymore. But for
that, the mind needs to be developed in order to see that without giving
in to that subtle attitude of either, “I want this” or “I don’t want
this”. And the only way to develop the mind to see such subtlety, it
needs to be able to endure the pressure sufficiently. You don’t need to
find the right second or moment in-between pressure, so to catch your
resistance before it happens. No. How do you become imperturbable? By
practising not being perturbed, through enduring? You stop moving and
the pressure to move will fade away because you’re not feeding it
anymore. You also don’t practise immovability in regard to everything
and nothing? No, in regard to the pressure that’s there on account of
what you’re currently feeling, that’s where you practice
endurance/<em>khanti</em>.</p>
<p>You need to find that level of presently enduring feeling, and don’t
move there. Everything else is fine, everything else is second to it,
everything else will fall in place, if you uproot the craving on the
level where it matters.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong></p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“And how is the nutriment of mental intention to be regarded? Suppose
there were a pit of glowing embers, deeper than a man’s height, full of
embers that were neither flaming nor smoking, and a man were to come
along — loving life, hating death, loving pleasure, resisting pain — and
two strong men, having grabbed him by the arms, were to drag him to the
pit of embers. To get far away would be that man’s intention, far away
would be his wish, far away would be his aspiration. Why is that?
Because he would realize, ‘If I fall into this pit of glowing embers, I
will meet with death from that cause, or with death-like pain.’ In the
same way, I tell you, is the nutriment of mental intention to be
regarded. When the nutriment of mental intention is understood, the
three forms of craving for sensual pleasures, craving for being, and
craving for non-being are understood. When the three forms of craving
are understood, I tell you, there is nothing further for a disciple of
the noble ones to do.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> What would be a practical example of mental
intention?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I want to go…</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> I want. That’s it. Wanting. I want this, I don’t
want that. Now, you can think, “Oh, okay, I don’t want my wanting or I
don’t want anything.”, but you can’t not want your wanting to be free of
wanting because that’s now what you want. So you can’t just want your
way out of your desire. The problem with the attitude of wanting is
whether it pertains to the five cords of sensual pleasure, one way or
the other, subtle or coarse. Is your wanting still pertaining to your
gratuitous assumption of safety in this world? Is it still based on the
gratuitous assumption of ownership, your own sense of self. Are those
wants still revolving around those things? Because that is what needs to
change.</p>
<p>That’s why the Buddha encourages us to replace the joys of sensual
life with the joys of renunciate life, of a life that says no to
sensuality. You can replace the miseries, the suffering of the sensual
life with the suffering of the renunciate life because it’s better. The
experiencing of joys and miseries for as long as you have the body, is
not optional. But what’s optional is what joys and miseries will be
experienced, whether they’re going to be pure or not, whether they’re
going to be causing more attachment or not, whether they’re going to be
causing more infatuation and lust or not. So replace the sensual ones
with the renunciate ones and sustain that and there will be no more
problems for you.</p>
<p>You can want anything else except the five cords sensual pleasures,
for example. That’s it. Sustain that context and you will overcome lust
or sensuality, because you’re not feeding it anymore through gratuitous
sustaining of wanting it, i.e. valuing it.</p>
<p>The joys of seclusion are used to replace the joys of a household
life. Pains of seclusion, pains of renunciation, replace the pains of a
household life, which are far worse, far more burdening and create much
further reaching consequences. Things you do on account of sensuality
now, will have many consequences in lives to come, not just in this one.
But pains of seclusion, renunciation pretty much end there, because
there’s nothing done on account of it. No other people are affected by
it, so it does not carry the same significance. And yet you used it to
now replace all this other burden that would have otherwise have caused
you so much more hassle.</p>
<p>That’s the mental wanting. It’s not like you cannot have it, but you
should certainly make sure that none of it is rooted in the domain of
the senses, in the domain of assumption of ownership. Is your wanting
based on getting more pleasure, or a gratuitous sense of safety? Or is
your wanting based on the practicality for living the holy life? Do you
want enough food, enough shelter? Enough robes or clothes? Enough means
to live by? Or is your wanting based on much more than that? So it’s
about replacing the bad wanting with good wanting, and then sustaining
the good wanting until you can completely disown even that.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why is it called nutriment?</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Well, because your sense of self, your being,
all of your assumptions are fed by it, dependent on it, sustained by it.
Whether you want it or not, through acting on it, you’re feeding it.
It’s a direct nutriment for <em>bhava</em>, for ego, for conceit, for
ownership. It’s a vicious circle.</p>
<p>There are four types of nutriment and what’s in common with all those
nutriments, is that they are nutriments for <em>bhava</em>, for your
sense of self when you take them wrongly. So the one who is free from
nutriment of food is free from <em>bhava</em> to that extent. An arahant
doesn’t stop eating food, but eating food ceases to be the nutriment for
his being because he has seen the danger in it. There is no wanting
anymore, no desire, no lust in regard to the nutriment of food. Thus, it
has ceased to be the nutriment for <em>bhava</em>, nutriment for his
being and misconceptions. There is no more pressure either. Pressure was
your wrong attitude which has been uprooted. As I said, “itch” is enough
in itself, it does not require a scratch nor even imply it.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> But it’s still an itch</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> There is still an itch, but it does not pressure
towards scratching it’s just an itch. So when you are not developed in
regard to the itch, your mind cannot resist the thoughts, the delight,
the pressure, the possibility of the scratch-to remove the itch. The
itch in itself is self sufficient. It’s enough. In the itch there is
just the itch. And if you start seeing it like that, you will not be
pressured to scratch it. The pressure of scratching it will fade
away.</p>
<p>As the Buddha said, <em>phassa</em>/pressure cannot pressure the
groundless one. The one that has no ground for that pressure to land, no
ownership, no delight, no lust in those thoughts of, “what if I only
scratch it..”, none of that, he completely disowned them all, thus the
thoughts of scratching do not pressure him anymore. The itch is there.
The thoughts of scratching might be there but there is no pressure to
scratch and then even the thoughts of scratching will fade away. And
then again in the itch there’s just the itch, in the seen there’s just
the seen, in the heard, just the heard and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong></p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“And how is the nutriment of consciousness to be regarded? Suppose
that, having arrested a thief, a criminal, they were to show him to the
king: ‘This is a thief, a criminal for you, your majesty. Impose on him
whatever punishment you like.’ So the king would say, ‘Go, men, and
shoot him in the morning with a hundred spears.’ So they would shoot him
in the morning with a hundred spears. Then the king would say at noon,
‘Men, how is that man?’ ‘Still alive, your majesty.’ So the king would
say, ‘Go, men, and shoot him at noon with a hundred spears.’ So they
would shoot him at noon with a hundred spears. Then the king would say
in the evening, ‘Men, how is that man?’ ‘Still alive, your majesty.’ So
the king would say, ‘Go, men, and shoot him in the evening with a
hundred spears.’ So they would shoot him in the evening with a hundred
spears. Now what do you think, monks: Would that man, being shot with
three hundred spears a day, experience pain and distress from that
cause?” “Even if he were to be shot with only one spear, lord, he would
experience pain and distress from that cause, to say nothing of three
hundred spears.” “In the same way, I tell you, monks, is the nutriment
of consciousness to be regarded. When the nutriment of consciousness is
understood, name and form are understood. When name and form are
understood, I tell you, there is nothing further for a disciple of the
noble ones to do.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> What’s the property of consciousness,
practically speaking? What do all those things have in common? They are
cognized. It’s the subtlest nutriment to understand. By understanding
the nutriment food, you can be an anagami, but there will still be
subtler forms of lust and aversion for “being”,“non-being” and remnants
of conceit. Consciousness is the subtlest type of nutriment to
understand because it’s on the level of the mere cognizing of
things.</p>
<p>Are you cognizing those things with the implication of “for me”,
“mine”, “I am”? Or are you cognizing those things as “not for me”, “not
mine”, “not I am”? Just like the Buddha encouraged the noble disciples
to regard everything.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why the simile of spears?</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Any form of cognising already carries the
conceit of “for me and mine”. So the only way to penetrate through that
is to, again, just like the other similes, to regard it as the most
horrible, perilous thing in the world, that must not be wanted, and then
sustaining that context as the framework for any cognizing that arises
until that cognizing is purified (of all conceivings), but you can’t do
it on the level of cognizing it’s just too subtle. And your tool for
doing it is cognizing, which is already corrupted by conceivings, by
conceit.</p>
<p>What you can do is develop the framework of, “Okay, so any form of
cognition, any situation I become self aware in, is like being struck
with a spear, it’s a peril, a pain, the possibility of death”. So, what
next? Nothing except sustaining that attitude and context, and there
will be no more basis for passion and lust to endure and proliferate.
It’s like the simile of “heating up a frying pan”, when the pan is
really hot, even if you throw a lot of water on it, it will evaporate
very quickly. That’s how you get rid of the conceit that’s affecting
your cognition, by providing a hot pan for it to evaporate. The context
is the hot pan of dispassion. The context should be, “This cognising is
a spear that I might die as a result of”.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, “What is my current situation? What is my current state
of mind? What is my current enduring feeling? What’s my current body
posture?” All of that is a form of cognizing. So on that general level,
that peripheral level, not on the particular level of, “I’m cognizing
the table, I’m cognising the book, I’m cognising the phone,…” No, “I’m
cognizing my current situation of such and such feeling enduring and I’m
sitting here”, that’s the spear. The broadest context you can find is
the spear, and that’s how you can then broaden even that context.
Broaden in a sense of developing it further, so it becomes even more
unsuitable for passion, for carelessness, for ownership. And if you find
that unpleasant, it’s only unpleasant because of your ownership that is
still there. If there is no ownership, it will not be unpleasant.</p>
<p>Same like when you put disinfecting alcohol on your skin. Unless your
skin is broken and infected, it won’t hurt. It hurts only because there
is a wound. But if you’re really unwise you will think, “It hurts
because of alcohol, thus I won’t put the disinfectant on. I will just
let the wound stay because I don’t want it to hurt.” When you develop
the context and it hurts, it hurts because there is a wound which means
if the wound heals, it will stop hurting without you needing to abandon
the context.</p>

<p><strong>Nm:</strong> If you fully developed the context of dispassion
in regard to anything that can be cognized, there will be no more
passion. In the cognised there will be just the cognised.</p>

The Meaning of Right Samadhi</h2>
<p><strong>Ajahn Nyanamoli:</strong> Could you give me a mundane example
of samadhi (composure)?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The inability to be disturbed by disturbing
events.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Like when someone is in a good mood throughout
the day, they are not affected by bad or disturbing events.</p>
<p>The reason why I’m asking this is because it’s not just the composure
of an idea (it is partially). But that idea implies emotional composure
as a background of it. So, a <em>mood</em> would be an example. Equally,
someone’s mind can be composed in a bad mood. This means that even good
things would annoy and irritate them.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Anything that happens comes within that bad mood.
Everything has a disagreeable baseline. Or an agreeable baseline if
they’re in a good mood.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes. Do people have a say in their moods?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> No. You can’t change it. It presents itself on
its own.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> That’s true on that level. Can you think of
another level in which a person does have a say in their mood?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Putting oneself in a good mood is possible. As an
example, reminding oneself of how fortunate one is compared to others.
Doing certain things, and reflecting in certain ways, keeps my mood from
getting bad.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes. The moods are indeed phenomena on their
own. However, are you allowing your wild mind to go where it wants? When
that happens, moods get depressed and agitated. Or are you trying to
restrain it? As a result, you will feel happier and lighter. Therefore,
you do not control the <em>phenomenon</em> of mood being present, but
you do control the indirect cultivation of that mood.</p>
<p>As the Buddha said, even if one lives a non-celibate life, i.e. a
householder’s life, but frequently recollects the Buddha, Dhamma,
Sangha, and their own virtue, then he will gain a pleasant abiding, a
good mood - a kind of <em>samadhi</em> right now. When the mind is
directed toward reflecting upon certain values, it becomes composed in
that direction. So, day after day, you want to make a practice of
reflecting upon the right things, even when you don’t feel like it.</p>
<p>If you want a higher pleasant abiding, that will require more
restraint, but it boils down to frequent remembrance and reflection.
That is what will incline the mind. Whatever one frequently thinks
about, that’s where the mind is inclined to go. Is it sensuality or
non-sensuality? Is it irritation, fault finding, ill will, or
non-irritation, non-fault finding, non-ill will? One direction inclines
to suffering and the other does not.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>On one occasion…The Blessed One said this: Bhikkhus, before my
enlightenment, while I was still seeking enlightenment, it occurred to
me:</p>
<p>Suppose that I divide my thinking into two classes. Then I set on one
side thinking pertaining to sensuality, aversion, and cruelty, and I set
on the other side thinking pertaining to non-sensuality, non-ill will,
and non-cruelty.</p>
<p>As I lived thus (in solitude), diligent, persistent, and vigilant,
sensual, (aversive or cruel) thinking arose in me. I understood thus:
‘This class of thinking leads to my affliction, to others’ affliction,
and the affliction of both; it obstructs wisdom, sides with
difficulties, and leads away from Nibbāna.’ When I considered this, that
type of thinking subsided in me; Whenever sensual, (aversive or cruel)
thinking arose in me, I abandoned it, tamed it, and brought it to an
end…</p>
<p>…Bhikkhus, whatever a bhikkhu frequently thinks(vitakka) and ponders
upon(vicara), will become the inclination of his mind. If he frequently
thinks and ponders upon sensuality, he has abandoned the thought of
non-sensuality to cultivate the thought of sensuality, and then his mind
inclines to sensual thinking. If he frequently thinks and ponders with
aversion, he has abandoned thinking with non-aversion…or if he
frequently thinks and ponders with cruelty, he has abandoned thinking
with non-cruelty,…and as such his mind inclines to those unwholesome
directions.</p>

<p>—MN 19</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Recollection versus Concentration</strong></p>
<p>How is <em>recollection</em> different from concentration? What is
concentration in mundane terms?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> It’s all about honing in on something specific at
the expense of everything else. For example, playing the piano or being
completely immersed in something that absorbs all your attention. The
piano is something you have to focus on, and if you lose focus for a
moment, you’ll make a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Basically, it’s all about paying attention to
what’s in front of you. Does that differ from recollection and
composure?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Yes, because concentration depends on the object
that you are focused on.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> How? Where is the dependence? Because you could
not care what you are concentrating on, but practice concentration on,
for example, anything that comes into your field of attention.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> It depends on that object staying the same and
not going away. Because if you are concentrating on anything that comes
into your field of attention then you wouldn’t call that concentration,
because it would be diverse. It would be any type of object.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> But that’s my point. Does it matter what object
it is in order to define concentration? Concentration is what you do.
So, you could concentrate on any object that comes your way, and still
practice concentration. Even if there are different objects. Can you
concentrate on ‘themes’ or the nature of things?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> So, what’s the difference then?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Concentrating</em> is paying sole attention
to a thing. Whereas <em>recollection</em> is more about discerning the
background or context of one’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> You could say, in mundane terms, that when you
concentrate, you are doing it, you are intentionally attending to a
specific thing. But when you are recollecting, you are remembering the
context in which a thing has presently arisen. You are not doing that
context, you are remembering it, as opposed to concentration which is an
act that you choose to do, which is at the expense of the bigger picture
- the context. Concentration is concerned with content, whereas
recollection is the discernment of context.</p>
<p>Recollection then is not about trying to focus on something
particular. But rather about remembering certain contexts so that the
mind becomes composed in them.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Developing such composure is done
<em>indirectly</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Exactly. By recollecting certain contexts the
mind will be encouraged in a specific direction. For example, seeing the
danger and lack of satisfaction of attending in the wrong direction. If
you sustain these themes, then the mind will turn away from the wrong
direction. And why can’t you do that with concentration? Why can’t you
just concentrate on your mind and make it go that way?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Because it’s not an object that you can attend
to.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Exactly. Some people think that they can
concentrate on their mind. However, you don’t see your mind when you’re
concentrating <em>with</em> it. It’s not a sense object.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> It’s always <em>before</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Exactly. In the same sense, if I were to be
looking at visual things, I couldn’t see my eyes there. That is
impossible. Or feeling tactile sensations, to see my body there. That is
impossible. The body is the background. The body is the organ because of
which you sense sensations.</p>
<p>Do you think concentration can be helpful in practice?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Initially it is needed for reading the Suttas and
getting information.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Sure, attending to the right things is
important. However, I’m referring to concentration as a practice. Is
that beneficial?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Yes. If the mind is inclining toward unwholesome
things, it could be helpful to intentionally direct it toward more
wholesome things.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> When one is concentrated, is it possible to
discern what is wholesome or not?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Some things are obviously unwholesome.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> But while being concentrated, do you have the
possibility of discerning whether you are attending to something
wholesome or not?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Not by virtue of concentration. If you could, it
would be at the expense of concentration.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> What is the point at which attention becomes a
concentration practice?……when recollection is lost.</p>
<p>You have no choice but to attend to things. Nevertheless, you can
learn not to over-attend and overlook the context, meaning, and
background of whatever you are currently attending. The background is
where your intentions are. And that context is what tells you what is
wholesome (I can allow it to be attended further) or unwholesome (I
should not welcome it, not delight in it, and make sure I don’t attend
particular signs and features that will increase these states).
Attending only to the content means ignoring the context. So, ironically
the concentration practice is directly opposite to the <em>samadhi</em>
practice. The <em>composition</em> of the context is <em>samadhi</em>.
Recollecting things rightly, that then sustains and inclines your mind
in a certain way. Concentration means overshooting the mark and
abandoning the context - even if it’s concentrating on good things.
That’s why the whole practice is to learn how not to overshoot
(concentrate) or undershoot (ignore, deny). Attend to something, but
don’t let it become a focusing concentration practice, because you
cannot possibly do that and at the same time discern the background
context of your intentionality, the meaning, and the mood behind all of
that.</p>
<p><strong>Right Recollections, Right Composures</strong></p>
<p>Can you give some examples of the right composure and right
recollection?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Seeing the body as the present background
context, whatever one is doing.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> How would you see that?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Don’t be too involved in what you are doing.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> What constitutes ‘too involved’?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Concentration</em> in the way we just
described.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> So, abstaining from concentration. Would that
then reveal the background?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Not necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> So, back to my original question. How do I
reveal the context or background?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> As the Suttas say, be aware of what you are
doing. Not in the sense of the actual object of activity that you are
doing, but what your body is doing in general. In the sense that ‘I’m
sitting’, ‘I’m walking’, ‘I’m lying down’, ‘I’m standing’ – as a way to
indirectly notice the fact that, no matter what you’re engaged with,
your body is always there as the background image.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> How would I prevent that from becoming my
concentration object?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> To understand that the body we are talking about
now cannot be seen as a sense object.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes, so how do you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Frequently reflect and ponder on it.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> And to frequently reflect and ponder on it, what
do I need?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> To not forget the theme.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Where do I get the theme from?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> From studying the Discourses.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes. You learn about the themes that counter
your whole experience. The normal tendency is to attend to what’s right
in front of you. That’s the definition of sensuality in general. Your
<em>being</em> existing on the level of sense objects. That’s the
measure of what’s real. So then whatever you come across, you make it an
object by overly attending it - <em>Ayoniso manasikara</em>.</p>
<p>In this case, you’ll learn the right things, but you’ll still make
them objects of your attention. By studying, hearing, recollecting,
discerning, and reclarifying, however, you will be learning how not to.
Consequently, you need to abandon all of your wrong views (that require
certain degrees of attention, concentration, assumptions of sense
objects, etc.) to maintain the right composure, and the right
establishment of the mind. The right view is therefore essential. So,
we’re back to what we always say. Without the right view, you cannot get
the right <em>samadhi</em> because it isn’t a technique. You cannot
become accomplished in it by following a set of mechanical instructions.
It’s the discernment of and anchoring in the right context, the right
mood. The mood of a neutral feeling that’s not perturbed by pleasant or
unpleasant, by agreeable or disagreeable.</p>
<p>When you study the Suttas, you will be able to get a better sense of
context and themes. It won’t take that much study to see that that’s
what the Buddha was often talking about.</p>
<p>How do you incline your mind towards wholesome and take it away from
unwholesome? Not by watching your belly movements, nostrils, or the
soles of your feet. But through your active thinking and reflection, you
sustain these values by pondering on potential dangers, potential
perils, lack of satisfaction, and benefits. That’s what the first
<em>jhana</em> is - a comprehension born of active thinking and
pondering that is fully withdrawn, separated, and gone beyond
sensuality.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> It takes effort to understand what the Suttas are
genuinely saying. You have to be willing to question your assumptions
about these things because you start from a position of ignorance and
wrong view. Everything is misunderstood. One has to consider that there
is another way to pay attention to things, a peripheral attention.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes. It is learning how to attend correctly
because you start by over-attending everything. Or not attending what
you need to attend. Either ignoring or over-attending. The Middle ground
of it is awareness of attention and its context, its origin, its womb
(<em>yoniso</em>). That needs to be discerned and learned first;
sustained; endured; and then recognized for what it is. And then, yes,
you can cultivate it. But even then, it won’t become an object of your
cultivation, in that concentration sense. Even though, in the broadest
theoretical sense, yes – it’s a phenomenon, a theme, an object that you
can think about.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> It’s an <em>indirect</em> way. Not directly
wanting to change what is in front of you but changing the context.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes, you guide or encourage your mind to follow
certain paths. Just like you can create pathways for the water to flow
in a specific direction.</p>
<p><strong>Right Context</strong></p>
<p>What are some examples of the right context?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The danger of craving or sensuality. The benefit
of restraint and virtue.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes, it is important to repeatedly consider the
dangers of non-virtue, sensuality, and ill-will, even if you are
virtuous and sense-restrained. That’s how you’ll cultivate those right
themes. As far as external actions are concerned, there is nothing more
you need to do. You don’t need to be adding new rules and random
observances. By actively thinking about certain themes, one cultivates
the right <em>samadhi</em> based on unbroken virtue. Setting the mind on
the right path.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Recollecting your virtue and experiencing the joy
of that, the body becomes calm, and the mind becomes happy. That is the
composure that leads to knowledge and vision.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Exactly. Your body will become calm and
agreeable as your mind is calmed and made agreeable by having directed
it to certain moods and themes. <em>Samadhi</em> then is a result of the
right recollection, right thinking, and right evaluation - right
<em>vitakka</em> and <em>vicara</em>. And anyone can sit for periods of
each day, and make their mind think about these themes and values. If
you spend a few days building that up, the right mood will begin to
persist and gather momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Losing Composure</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Let’s say somebody says something to you and you
get angry. In frustration, you lose your <em>samadhi</em>. How should
you proceed?</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> The first recognition is that if you got
actively angry, you didn’t have samadhi in the first place. If you were
cultivating these themes and actively reflecting upon them, you wouldn’t
give in when anger arises. And you would see that difference now. If you
have gone on a long-distance mental journey in a good direction (of
non-anger) and somebody from a bad direction comes and tries to entice
you. Yes, it might make you turn around and start walking a bit in that
direction. But it’s still quite a walk to go back into the bad domain -
actively getting angry. And you will see that.</p>
<p>You will gain confidence because of that, thinking, “I don’t need to
panic and start fighting with the mind. Yes, it got a bit distracted.
However, let me endure this thing that’s trying to take my attention
through sensuality or anger and, instead, keep cultivating the same
indirect themes, cultivations, and contexts.” The further the mind goes
in that direction of abandonment and seclusion from the unwholesome, the
harder it will be to get disturbed by things that are at a vast distance
away. So, if you have spent a few days thinking about these contexts and
you still end up angry over something, it means you need to spend more
time cultivating the right context. Each time you develop the right
reflection and recollection – constantly thinking about those values –
the mind is travelling a little further in a good direction, and it will
continue to do so for as long as your virtue and sense restraint remain
unbroken.</p>
<p>You have to resist the urge to deal with your anger head-on. Because
that will require abandoning the context and entangling yourself in the
content to try to get rid of it. That’s why I keep saying that most
contemporary meditation practices are rooted in aversion and sensuality.
Trying to get rid of things that bother you and replacing it with a
sense pleasure - ‘antidoting’ this with that. Which requires you to
abandon the context or not have it to begin with.</p>
<p>This is how you protect your <em>samadhi</em>. Recognizing where the
importance lies. Reflecting on what you value. Thinking about the
dangers of losing those values and having the mind return to states that
are unbeneficial. Remembering all the joy, lightness, and clarity you
got as a result of establishing the right mood. Recollecting the fact
that the things that used to make you furious or lustful haven’t moved
you now, and if you forget about that, your mind will slowly drift back
into those unwholesome domains. Unless, of course, those impurities have
been fully uprooted.</p>
<p>There is no need to fight things directly. All you need is virtue,
sense restraint, solitude, and an active practice of thinking about and
reevaluating these wholesome themes. And when that practice becomes dry
and the mind starts getting distracted, it’s not about finding something
new to do. It’s about finding ways to rekindle the same things – until
the mind has travelled far enough away from unwholesome pastures and
burnt all bridges whereby it’s impossible to return.</p>

How To Abandon Self View</h2>
<p><strong>Ajahn Nyanamoli</strong>: What is the result of a successful
practice?</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Not being bothered as much.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: In that case, what can happen is that when
people get inspired to practice, they end up constructing an environment
around them whereby nothing bothers them; where everything is at arm’s
length; and it feels like their practice is succeeding because they
don’t suffer as much factually. They end up measuring their success by
how much better they can manage their suffering. Which, suffice to say,
is quite unfortunate.</p>
<p>How would you know that you are practicing correctly? How is not
being bothered practically measured in terms of the insight talked about
in the suttas?</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: What about if your mind moves less on account of
the thought of dying?</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: What do the suttas define as the culminating
insight required for a mind to not move on account of dying?</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Anicca.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: What’s the insight that anicca and dukkha
culminate in?</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Anatta.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: Exactly, that is the culminating insight. The
complete cessation, first of self-view, then of conceit. And when that
is completely gone without any trace – you couldn’t suffer even if you
want to.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Is the measure that the less somebody takes
things personally, the more they are progressing in the practice?</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: It could be. But you also have
psycho-therapeutical methods that teach you how ‘not to take things
personally’. But you’re taking <em>that</em> personally. So, it has to
be an actual insight into anatta. And anatta is not something you can
stumble upon accidentally. That’s why you need the voice of another and
yoniso manasikara (concurrent attention) based on sense restraint. It’s
a factual, irreversible insight. Seeing anicca and dukkha is just so
that you can experience the anatta.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“There are monks, these two conditions for the arising of the right
view. Which are the two? The voice of another, and yoniso manasikara.
These, monks, are the two conditions for the arising of the right
view.”</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: You can say my mind won’t be bothered by even the
thought of dying. But anatta is more fundamental than becoming so
mentally strong that nothing bothers you.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: Yes. That’s a necessary prerequisite for
insight. As the Buddha said during his life, some teachers could help
one establish neither-perception-nor-non-perception, which means you are
pretty much unbothered by anything inferior to that. But only in the
dispensation of the Buddha could one attain the anatta part. The suttas
say that an Arahant’s mind doesn’t get overwhelmed by things – an
Arahant’s mind overwhelms things. That is the factual strength, without
which one couldn’t understand and fully develop the anatta.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“When a bhikkhu dwells thus, (restraint, recollected, wise, and
liberated), he overwhelms forms; forms do not overwhelm him. He
overwhelms sounds; sounds do not overwhelm him. He overwhelms odors;
odors do not overwhelm him. He overwhelms tastes; tastes do not
overwhelm him. He overwhelms tactile objects; tactile objects do not
overwhelm him. He overwhelms mental phenomena; mental phenomena do not
overwhelm him. This is called a bhikkhu who overwhelms forms, who
overwhelms sounds, who overwhelms odors, who overwhelms tastes, who
overwhelms tactile objects, who overwhelms mental phenomena—one who
overwhelms and who is not overwhelmed. He has overwhelmed those evil
unwholesome states that defile, that lead to being, that bring trouble,
that result in suffering, and that perpetuate birth, aging, and
death.<br />

<p>But say you have been sense restrained, seeing the danger in the
slightest fault, guarding the sense doors, keeping the precepts, living
in solitude. If you are meeting the requirements to start seeing and
abandoning attavada(self-view),… what then is self-view? Is it something
that would occur, and you can interpret it in hindsight? Or do you need
to know where to look for it, to see it and recognize it? What’s the
necessary basis for anatta?</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Seeing atta (self).</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: Yes. What is atta then?</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: You can’t put it in front of you – it’s always
peripheral.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: Yes, the properties of atta – the sense of self
– are that it’s not directly visible. You can’t access it through your
senses. You can’t observe it with your five senses, and you can’t say
‘this is my “Self” that I am relating to’. It’s always ambiguous. What
else? Do you have the experience of when that self is not there?</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: It’s always there to some degree. Sometimes it
might feel clearer or more ambiguous. But that sense of self – the
center of experience – is always there. Do you see it right now as we
speak – the sense of self enduring on its own – somehow ambiguously
lingering?</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: To some degree. Accepting its allusivity is
important when it comes to seeing it on its own terms.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: That’s the key there. The way to see it is on
its own terms. That is what solitude and the practice of mindfulness
are. Not how to make it into an object of observation that I think it
should be.</p>
<p><u><strong>The Present Memory</strong></u></p>
<p>Mindfulness is the memory of your present experience. By abandoning
the views of mindfulness being concentration on the present moment you
realize that there’s nothing complicated about it. Having the memory of
the present moment while we speak – that’s what mindfulness is. The
practice of memory here and now.</p>
<p>It’s like a different angle of attending to what is directly attended
in front of me – yoniso manasikara. If I ask you to recall a memory, how
would you do that? Focus on sensations and your breathing? No, it would
be the opposite. You would de-focus on what you were focusing on, to
recall or recollect what is there.</p>
<p>That point of view – of memory – whether it’s the memory of this
second or the memory of 10 years ago, is the same point of view. It’s
the point of view that you can use to observe the present experience; at
the same time, you are (indirectly) in the present experience. It’s the
background of your current absorbed attention. It’s the ‘point of view’
of your senses. It’s where the mind is.</p>
<p>That ambiguous ‘sense of self’ is neither here (in the senses) nor
there (in the sense objects); it’s in between the two.</p>
<p>If you’re of the view that that sense of self is something you can
think directly, or that it’s something you can access through your
senses directly, or that it’s something you can observe and see as
‘anatta’; you are not seeing anatta. You are just chasing the idea that
you have intellectually developed – on account of reading the suttas or
listening to talks. The sense of self is always behind from where you
are looking. When you realize that the range of where you can look is
either the direction of where you attend or the direction of the memory
point of view; you realize that you don’t need to know specifically
where the sense of self is. You know that it will have to be between the
two points of view – that are there at the same time running
concurrently.</p>
<p>“With this, this is”. It’s not that the memory point of view (where
the mind is) comes first, in the sense that it exists apart from the
senses. No, they exist simultaneously. One is the way of direct
attention, and the other is the knowledge of direct attention (yoniso
manasikara). That’s why sati and memory are used interchangeably in the
suttas. The problem is that when one hears the word ‘memory’ one can
have the view of the past. But, even if it’s the past, it’s presently
recollected. Then you realize that you could practice, instead of only
recollecting the past; recollect what is presently enduring. Not
allowing myself to directly attend to it but knowing it on the level of
memory.</p>
<p>Are you seated now? Yes. That’s a present memory. You don’t need to
feel your knees. The recognition of that simultaneously enduring point
of view is there. It’s two points of observance of the same thing.
Because they are <em>two</em> points of view (not one), neither can be
in charge or master of the experience. With this, this is. Without this,
this wouldn’t be. Either way, there’s no room for ownership.</p>
<p>Let’s say you start practicing sati correctly in solitude. You are
recollecting what you are presently doing instead of being absorbed into
attending to what you are presently doing. Keeping that peripheral point
of view. Watching what is present – sitting, breathing, etc… The memory
of current breathing is what anapanasati is. It’s not the accessing of
it through directly attending the sensations of it, but accessing it
through the indirect knowledge (point of view) of it. The recognition of
the images of breathing that you are doing. That’s what memory is.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Sati, in a loose sense, can certainly be translated as”memory” but
memory is normally memory of the past, whereas in the eight-factored
path sati is more particularly concerned with the present. In so far as
one can speak of memory of the present, this translation will do, but
memory of the present—i.e. calling to mind the present—is less
confusingly translated as “mindfulness.” Here are two Sutta passages
illustrating these two meanings of sati: in the first passage sati is
“memory,” and in the second it is “mindfulness.” The passages can be
translated as follows:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>The noble disciple is mindful, he is endowed with the highest
mindfulness (memory) and prudence, he remembers and recalls what was
done and what was said long ago. (SN 48:50/S V 275)</p></li>
<li><p>Here, monks, a monk dwells contemplating the body in the body…
feelings in feelings… the mind in the mind… ideas in ideas, ardent,
aware, mindful, having put away worldly covetousness and grief. Thus,
monks, is a monk mindful. (SN 36:7/S IV 211)”</p></li>

<p>The atta (sense of self) – however ambiguous, fleeting, or unclear it
might be – it’s real as such. Instead of you trying to ‘see myself on
the level of directly attended experience’, you see it for whatever it
is – however it is: A thick cloud; sometimes palpable; sometimes not…
But the sense of self, the sense of ‘I am’ is there, lingering. In other
words, you can’t go behind it. You can’t become the observer of it and
turn it into an object. It’s always in the background.</p>
<p>How do you make it not perpetually escape you?</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: It will always be allusive.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: Everybody can recognize its ambiguity, but then
they feel a pressure, impulse, or tendency to try and clarify it. They
think that the only way they can relate to it is if it is more defined.
But it’s not. It’s an ambiguous phenomenon. It’s neither here nor there,
but it is real as such. That’s why you shouldn’t dismiss it, redefine
it, or mystify it; it’s a real phenomenon like any other thing. If you
try to directly access it, it’s always going to slip through your
fingers.</p>
<p>So first you realize that you cannot make it <em>not</em> allusive.
It’s going to stay allusive. You need to accept the ambiguity of it, as
its characteristic. That’s enough for you to recognize it as being
there.</p>
<p>How do you access it without grabbing it?</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: By recollecting it.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: By surmounting it in the sense that we just
described. There is an ambiguous thing that’s neither in my senses nor
away from it. It’s kind of always there. But wherever it is, it
<em>must</em> be in between this and this: What I am directly attending,
and the knowledge of what I am directly attending. It cannot be outside
of these two directions. Recollect that frequently and in solitude –
based on your currently enduring sense of self (not just theoretically).
This sense of self that you’re not trying to define, or ignore, has to
be in between ‘this and this’ (the two simultaneous points of view).</p>
<p>Becoming established in that idea is how you uproot the sense of
self. You don’t uproot it immediately. You uproot the view that the
sense of self can be outside ‘this, and this’; outside of the experience
as a whole; outside of the five aggregates – whichever way you want to
define it.</p>
<p>If I look in the direction of what I am attending, or in the
direction of memory; those are the two ends. Nothing can be outside of
these. Although this sense of self feels inaccessible directly, it’s
always there, and none of this pertains to it; it has to be within this.
It cannot be outside of it because all I have is ‘this, and this’. Even
the thought ‘outside’ of this experience, and the external world; is
within ‘this, and this’; within the attending it and having the memory
of it.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Sir, are these the five assumed aggregates: form, feeling,
perception, intentions, and consciousness?”</p>
<p>“Yes, they are,” replied the Buddha.</p>
<p>The mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he
asked another question: “But sir, what is the root of these five assumed
aggregates?”</p>
<p>“These five assumed aggregates are rooted in desire.”</p>
<p>“But sir, is that assumption the same thing as the five assumed
aggregates? Or is the assumption one thing and the five assumed
aggregates another?”</p>
<p>“Neither. Rather, the desire and greed for them is the assumption
there.”</p>

<p><u><strong>Two Directions, two points of view - concurrent
attention.</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: That’s all that appears – ‘with this, this
is’.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: And a lot more appears in between – but not
outside of it. When I say ‘in between’, I don’t mean in a third place
between the two. I mean, based on these two simultaneous directions.
That’s why the Buddha described Namarupa Vinnana, Vinnana Namarupa. They
mutually determine each other. Neither comes before the other. They are
two sheaves of reeds leaning on each other equally. They cannot remain
standing if one is removed.</p>
<div class="english">

<p>“Just as two sheaves of reeds might stand leaning against each other,
so too, with name-and-form as condition, consciousness comes to be; with

sense bases as condition, contact…. Such is the perpetuation of this
whole mass of suffering.</p>
<p>“If, friend, one were to remove one of those sheaves of reeds, the
other would fall, and if one were to remove the other sheaf, the first
would fall. So too, with the cessation of name-and-form comes the
cessation of consciousness; with the cessation of consciousness comes
the cessation of name-and-form. With the cessation of name-and-form

<p><strong>Q</strong>: It might be useful to mention two common wrong
views to illustrate what you mean by these two directions, for example,
empiricism and idealism.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: Both imply that one direction comes first.
Materialism, empiricism, and the scientific view are based on the
assumption that ‘what is attended to [through the senses]’ comes first.
Then you can have solipsism, idealism, or all sorts of variations that
are based on the assumption that ‘the mind’ comes first. The Buddha
discovered that they are simultaneous to the same extent. That is
paticcasamuppada in a nutshell: ‘With this, this is’; ‘Without this,
this wouldn’t be’. That’s it.</p>
<p>The Arahant does not destroy these two things to become an Arhant. He
just removes any traces of ignorance regarding it. Practically (as
opposed to theoretically), there is what you are currently attending to,
for example, ‘the seated body here and now’; and ‘the thought about the
seated body here and now’. I can have a memory of that ‘here and now’, I
can have a memory of what that ‘here and now’ was yesterday, two, days
ago, etc… And by withdrawing and expanding my mind from the senses, I
could have a memory past this life. The point is, it’s still within the
same two points of view that are simultaneously present.</p>
<p>These two points of view are all you ever have, it’s just that there
are wrong views about what comes first; and everything else in between.
That generally results in the weight of this experience being put on the
sense of self as the owner – outside of this: The sense of self can
remember, the sense of self can attend, the sense of self can do both,
and look in between. But then you realize that that sense of self, as
ambiguous as it is, is still an arisen phenomenon that you can have a
memory of. It’s actually an object. Not an object that you can direct
your attention to, but in its own regard, it’s a thing as such that
exists in your mind. Thus, you are not it.</p>
<p>Now you can <em>say</em> there’s no sense of self, but there is a
sense of self. You just need to stop putting it first. Find that upon
which it depends. And see your experience as fundamentally determined
simultaneously by two points of view at once: One of memory, and one of
direct attention. It means neither of them can be the center or master
of the experience. When there are two, there cannot be one owner. Any
notion of the external world, any notion of scientific observation; has
to be within these two points of view. Any notion of a solipsistic world
where ‘I’ is first; has to be within these two points of view –
Paticcasamuppada.</p>

<p>Often, when people asked the Buddha about the sense of self; saying
that ‘Master Gotama says there is no self [implying that non-self is a
self]’ or any other mysticism; he would just be silent. However, on some
other occasions, people did ask him the same question and he replied –
but not to their question. He would say ‘with this, this is’, ‘with
Vinnana, Namarupa; with Namarupa, Vinnana’. Why would he give that
answer to ‘where is my sense of self?’. Then you realize that it’s
because that is where the sense of self is.</p>
<p>Fully understanding ‘with this, this is’. Understanding that there is
no ‘outside’ of these two directions. There is then the abandoning of
the sense of self when you see that it is always undermined by the other
direction. That’s the most direct answer for how to develop ‘not
self’.</p>
<p>The Buddha could describe ‘with this, this is’ (paticcasamuppada) in
many different subtle details. But fundamentally, all you need to
contemplate is the principle ‘with this, this is’ on the right
level.</p>
<p>With what, what is? With this – that which I’m directly attending to
(my experience as a whole); and with this – the image of the experience
as a whole – the memory of it simultaneously present. If that
image-memory was not there, you wouldn’t know the experience as a whole,
as the experience you are attending to. These two points of view are
simultaneous/concurrent: One feeds the other, one defines the other. If
there are no senses that are attending and operating in their own
domain, there would be nothing to have an image of. If there is no
image, recollection, or memory of the senses and the world that the
senses are in; nothing would be intelligible. You would not be a
conscious being.</p>
<p>So what then is the practice?</p>
<p>Whatever happens throughout the day – make sure that you don’t forget
the context of ‘with this, this is’.</p>
<p>Whether you’re recollecting birth or death, or Namarupa Vinnana; the
principle of ‘with this, this is’; the principle of two simultaneously
present things and everything else in between; always remains the same.
The monk who establishes that rightly, doesn’t take ‘I’ to be first (to
be his own), or forms in the world, or mental objects. Everything else
in between – the feelings arising on account of perceptions, and all of
the other experiences in between this relationship – he then equally
won’t take as his.</p>
<p>If you make the effort to not ignore this right order, then whatever
you’re experiencing – based on sense restraint, virtue and solitude, you
include in the order ‘with this, this is’ – there is no outside of it.
It doesn’t matter if it’s more on the mental memory side or more on the
palpable side; that’s why we keep saying the content doesn’t matter. The
nature of things matters. It’s present as such. Whichever way it feels,
it’s got to be felt within ‘with this, this is’ – not outside of it.</p>
<p>And when I think ‘outside of it’, that’s within the enduring body
here, and the memory of the enduring body here. It’s still enclosed
within the same principle. The moment you hammer that in, whereby you
cannot forget that there is no outside of ‘with this, this is’ – that’s
where your attavada is gone. You continue to operate externally. You
might still look the same. But your assumption of external to ‘with
this, this is’ is now inconceivable – because it is inconceivable.
‘Conceiving’ is seen within it. Because you have developed the
perspective of ‘with this, this is’ sufficiently enough to include the
wildest of your careless fantasies, imaginations, assumptions… It’s
still seen rightly, as second – within it.</p>
<p>Now if you sustain, invest effort, purify, establish, and endure that
view; there will be no room for the slightest traces of conceit to
remain. You might have abandoned the view of the external entity of ‘me’
existing independent of it, but there will still be subtler habits,
leanings, and cravings implying independence (between ‘this’ and
‘this’). You might think ‘it’s still within “this and this” but it’s a
bit independent’. Then you realize even <em>that</em> cannot stand
outside these two directions. If the principle of paticcasamuppada is
thoroughly developed, dhamma is fulfilled. That’s why the suttas say
‘one who sees paticcasamuppada, sees the dhamma’. There’s no delay
there. It’s the right view that, if you cultivate it, can only result in
the direct purification of your being. Removal and cessation of passion,
greed, aversion, and delusion. Because all of those things imply a
degree of that conceit, self-centeredness, and craving. But none of that
can stand if this right view is hammered in.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Now this has been said by the Blessed One:”One who sees dependent
origination sees the Dhamma; one who sees the Dhamma sees dependent
origination.” And these five aggregates affected by assumption are
dependently arisen. The desire, indulgence, inclination, and holding
based on these five aggregates affected by assumption is the origin of
suffering. The removal of desire and lust, the abandonment of desire and
lust for these five aggregates affected by assumption is the cessation
of suffering.’ At that point too, friends, much has been done by that
bhikkhu.”</p>

<p><u><strong>Beyond right view</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Could it be correct to say that the removal of
attavada is to see that view of paticcasamuppada rightly – as you
described? And then you don’t need the view anymore. You can’t even have
that pure view anymore if that conceit is removed because you would
<em>be</em> it. In the sense that paticcasamuppada is what you are.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: Yes. For an Arahant, because there are no more
traces of conceit left, he doesn’t need to recollect and re-establish
that view – because there’s nothing perverting it. The suttas say that
‘the Arahant has gone beyond the view’. Which means, even the right view
is gone. He doesn’t have it anymore because he has no wrong reference
regarding it anymore – to define it.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Whereas someone who sees that has another
reference point.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: And he can fall back onto the fetters that he
hasn’t abandoned. He can’t fall back beyond that. So a sotapanna can
abandon his training, become careless, and not invest more effort into
sustaining and purifying this view that he has; but he cannot spill
outside with his assumptions of attavada, the external ‘self’, or the
‘over there’. That’s inconceivable because, even when the mind has those
thoughts, they’re seen in the background of the memory of ‘with this,
this is’.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: And that’s effortless. It’s just seen like that.
It cannot not be seen like that.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: Exactly. The effort is on the level of acting
out of the habits, pressures, and passions. Including trying to get rid
of it directly, through all sorts of practices. That’s the effort. But
the view in itself requires no effort.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Because it’s not like a view that you hold.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: Well, in a way, any view is effortless. Worldly
views are effortless. That’s why they’re so hard to uproot. You don’t
even see how you’re doing them, because you’re not doing them
directly.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: So, whether it’s effortless or not, is not what
makes the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: What makes the difference is whether it’s right
or wrong. Whether it’s contradicting the order of things, the
arrangement of the aggregates, the experience as a whole, etc… or not.
Whether it’s aligned with the order of things, the arrangement of the
aggregates, etc. That’s why the term ‘dhamma’ is used interchangeably as
phenomena and the knowledge of ‘the way out’.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: It’s still a phenomenon in both cases.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: It’s a phenomenon, yes. It’s just rightly
established, the right order of phenomena, and the wrong order of
phenomena. There is no third option. If the right order of phenomena is
established ‘with this, this is’, dispassion will have to be an
inevitable result. Like the simile of the river sloping down the
mountain – the water has to go that way because that’s where the
mountain slopes. If your slope is established upon the right order, the
mind will have to slope towards nibbana, dispassion, cooling down,
removal of ownership, and any traces of ownership of atta.</p>
<p>The moment you start seeing ‘the self’ (that ambiguous phenomenon we
started describing) as ‘an ambiguous phenomenon that endures there
peripherally’ – that’s already the beginning of relinquishing the
ownership of it. That’s why I keep saying that <em>you</em> don’t remove
the attavada – you remove the ownership of it. Because it’s neither here
nor there – but it’s known to be between the two. Thus, atta becomes
an-atta. But the thing is there. The creature or individual – whatever
you want to call it – is still there. That ambiguous sense of self of
these 5 aggregates, of these memories, future plans, and everything else
remains there; it’s just impossible to own.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Perhaps it’s necessary to emphasize that it’s
‘<em>direction</em>’; you can never access an endpoint to the
direction.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: Even if you’re not necessarily thinking about
either direction, you realize that you are within the two. Your
non-thinking, your distraction, is within ‘with this, this is’. It’s
within: What’s presently attended to, and the memory of it – even if it
is presently unattended to in unawareness.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: What do you think about defining ‘with this, this
is’ in terms of ‘the direction of what is attended to’ and ‘the
direction of where attention is coming from’?</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: Exactly. That’s what <em>yoniso</em> is. The
womb of what you’re looking at. They are simultaneously present as ‘with
this, this is’. So what you’re looking at, or touching, etc… it’s there
where that image is. It’s not in you: ‘In me’ it’s ‘there’ where that
image is. So, it’s just outside and more outside (internally
speaking).</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Inaccessible.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: Yes, inaccessible. That’s why the description of
an Arahant says ‘all that’s left is this conscious body, and
name-and-form externally’. Because he has completely abandoned
everything that needed to be abandoned on account of seeing the
principle of ‘with this, this is’. The more you practice these two
internal points of view (attention and present memory); the more
external the whole thing becomes. They are becoming two external points
of view, and thus there is nothing ‘in me’.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“When a bhikkhu has no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency
to conceit regarding this conscious body; and in regard to all
name-and-form externally; and when he enters and dwells in that
liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, through which there is no more
I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit for one who
enters and dwells in it, he is called a bhikkhu who has cut off craving,
stripped off the fetter, and, by completely breaking through conceit,
has made an end of suffering”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>– <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.33">AN 3.33</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The image ‘in me’ is already external to my own sense of self. The
sense of self is external to itself thus it’s not mine. That’s why it’s
a bit ambiguous in the suttas between the usage of ‘internal’ and
‘external’. Sometimes ‘internal’ basically stands for ‘mine’ – because
that’s where ‘mine’ is. Here, you will start internally, stop assuming
the external world, and in the end; that ‘internal’ non-assumption of
the external world is seen as a thing ‘out there’ – with purification
from attavada. That’s like the body there ‘to the extent necessary’. The
image of the body, the memory of the body there, understood as ‘body
there’, to the extent necessary for the final knowledge and the final
uprooting of passion.</p>
<p>There’s nothing mystical about it. You can have a memory from ten
years ago, ten days ago, or you can have a memory of what you’re doing
right now. The image of it is the memory of it. Simultaneously present,
enduring, giving the context to what you’re attending. But you need to
stop putting yourself first, as the one who remembers, and start seeing
yourself as an enduring thing: within that memory, and the world that is
directly attended to (the senses and the objects of your attention).</p>
<p>The mind and the five senses; <em>that’s</em> the experience as a
whole. ‘With this, this is’, and any notion of self, ownership,
consciousness, feelings, decisions, past and future plans, griefs, joys…
it’s all within these two, utterly inaccessible directions. They are
just two sheaves of reeds holding each other. Everything dear to me or
not dear to me is just gratuitously sitting there on top of these, i.e.,
it cannot be mine.</p>
<p><u><strong>Remembering the right order</strong></u></p>
<p>The practice of sati is the practice of memory, for example, of your
present body posture. <em>Memory</em> – not direct attention. Have a
memory of your presently enduring body posture. Have a memory of your
presently enduring feeling. Have a memory of your presently enduring
thoughts. Again, the memory of it. So emphasize the memory point of
view, not the directly attending point of view. That’s how the signs of
the mind will become apparent. That’s how the shape of the ambiguous
state of mind and sense of self is going to be discerned.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: That memory is uprooting atta. In the sense that
no matter what choices ‘I’ make, ‘I’ have to be within ‘with this, this
is’.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: Exactly. It resets the right order. Then when
you inevitably have the thought that took you away from the principle of
‘with this, this is’, you don’t negate it, or try to get rid of it, stop
thinking, focus… No, you have a memory of having it right here and now –
because it is here and now. You do that long enough and the fact that
it’s inconceivable for it to be outside of ‘with this, this is’, will
become established. There is no going back from there.</p>
<p>Even if you then stop recollecting the two directions, a sotapanna’s
knowledge cannot be undone – that it cannot be outside of these
directions. I can ignore this knowledge because I’m too occupied with
the world or family. It doesn’t matter – the knowledge that it cannot be
outside of ‘with this, this is’ is still there. The gratuitous
assumption of a self, living there independently (an owner) – and the
entire mass of suffering that is dependent on that deeply rooted
perversion – is gone. That’s why there is no ‘second arrow’ hitting an
Ariya Savaka as the suttas describe. Because that deeply perverted
order, that projected you out there into even worse circumstances than
you already are in, is gone.</p>
<p>Craving is bad, the conceit is bad but not as bad as the wrong view
of attavada. Not as bad as the level of perversion that ignores ‘with
this, this is’. The more you pervert this order, the more you own the
self. Which means, the heavier it is. Which means, losing it is going to
be far worse. Somebody with only traces of conceit; if they were to lose
their life, health, or things that were dear to them; won’t suffer. As a
sotapanna, you would have seven grains of sand of suffering left, in
comparison to the Himalayas that were destroyed by getting the right
view and ceasing to assume outside of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Because you know the escape.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: Yes, and factually the burden – to a great
degree – has been made inconceivable. That’s also why the right view
(freeing yourself of the assumption of self) surpasses all assumptions
(upadanas). Because attavada is on the level of ‘with this, this is’.
The upadana (or assumption) of ‘virtue and duty’ (silabatta parāmāsa),
sensuality (kama), and all of the other wrong views, are not on the
level of ‘with this, this is’. All views are contained within ‘with
this, this is’. Somebody who has understood it is a sotapanna – is free
from attavada – even though they might not be free from sensuality, ill
will, and all of the other things that are in between.</p>
<p><u><strong>The Earth element</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Can we explore this <a
href="https://suttacentral.net/mn62">discourse</a> where the Buddha
talks to Rahula about these five elements? He starts talking first about
the earth element; then he mentions hair of the head, hair of the body,
skin, teeth… Then he says, ‘that which is internally clung to or held as
mine’ is undermined by the fact that ‘internal earth element’ and
‘external earth element’ both are earth element. Can we also contemplate
that sutta by discerning that you cannot just have internal earth
element, you cannot just have external earth element: You need to have
both, for any of this to be – for all elements.</p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: Yes. And that could also stand for the principle
of ‘with this, this is’. It’s not on the level of directly attending to
earth and staring at a piece of soil. It’s recollecting the great earth.
Have a memory of what you are already in: ‘Be like earth’ – recall the
properties of the earth that’s currently enduring.</p>
<p>Earth is not elsewhere while we talk and forget about it. You are on
earth. Factually it’s there, it endures as the basis for your
experience. What are the properties of that ‘external’ earth? Can this
‘internal’ earth that I’m paired with control any properties outside the
properties of the earth – that are different from it? That would not be
affected if the great earth is affected? That’s inconceivable.</p>
<p>Sustain that image; ‘with this, this is’ – there will be no room for
the ownership to remain there clinging to this part or that part. You
won’t be able to assume ‘I’m not this body but I am the universe’. Which
universe? The one that changes against your will all the time –
forcefully, violently, disrupts, erupts, gets destroyed? Look at those
mountains – they come to destruction eventually. What is to be said of
this tiny fickle body, in relation to the size of them – that’s equally
unpredictable? ‘With this, this is’. The properties of this, cannot not
be the properties of this inferior thing. That’s the practice of kasinas
in a nutshell. The elements of earth, fire, water, air, space,
consciousness…</p>
<p>The Buddha would describe a Brahmin establishing his mind on the
level of that great earth. Anything inferior to that cannot perturb him.
If you’re always thinking about the presently enduring earth, while
you’re here on it, you’ll probably develop the contemporary
<em>eco-anxiety</em> – worrying about what will happen to the earth.
Even if it’s not ecology related, you’re going to have anxiety if you’re
not relinquishing your sense of self. If you don’t know what comes first
and what to look for. Because you realize that all of your life’s
concerns, joys, possessions, future, past… presuppose this enduring
planet of earth. You are bound with this great lump of soil that is
simultaneously present; as an uncontrollable, unownable basis for
experience. Now, if your mind is established on that level, i.e. it has
relinquished the ownership of everything inferior to the earth; any
changes inferior to the earth changing could not bother you.</p>
<p>However, those Brahmins that could factually establish their minds in
the right order, on the right level, and to the right extent; did not
know the gratification, danger, and escape regarding that great earth.
The Tathāgata knows it, and that’s why he’s free in both regards. Those
Brahmins, outside of the Buddha’s dispensation, who developed the mind
on the level of the earth, had to some extent put it first. They did not
see ‘with this, this is’: They did not see that their memory, knowledge,
image, or recollection of the earth; wouldn’t be possible if it weren’t
for ‘this, here immediate earth’. They went too far this side or too far
on the other side. They saw a certain relationship of surmounting, but
they didn’t see that that great earth is defined, as such, on account of
this little body. That’s why the entire universe is within this body.
That is the measure of the universe, and the universe then defines this
body. So ‘with this, this is’.</p>
<p>The same goes for somebody concerned with this inferior earth as an
internal ‘me’, or ‘my body’. You can cultivate and apply the properties
of that great earth to it; that is unbothered by people throwing stuff
on it, digging it, and destroying it. These things make no difference to
the great earth. Apply those same properties to this internal body –
because it is the same element – and you will see that it’s your
ownership that created that gratuitous division of ‘mine’; ‘internal’
and ‘external’ etc…</p>
