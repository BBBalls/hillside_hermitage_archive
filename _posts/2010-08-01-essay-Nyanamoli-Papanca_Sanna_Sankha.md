an essay

by **Ajahn Nyanamoli Thero**



This compound has represented, to paraphrase John D. Ireland from his
Udāna translation notes, a stumbling block which even the ancient
commentaries find difficult to define. If the importance of the term is
to be deduced from the extent of its difficulty then indeed
understanding of this compound carries a lot of significance in regard
to grasping of the Buddha’s Teaching.

There are various translations of
<span lang="pi">*papañca-saññā-sankhā*</span>, with currently the most
prominent ones being either Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi’s “notions \[born of\]
mental proliferations” translating the term
<span lang="pi">*papañca*</span> as ‘proliferation’; or Ven. Ñāṇamoli
Thera’s “calculations of perceptions of diversifications” where he
renders papañca as ‘diversification’. Beyond these two, plus the PTS
Dictionary definition, I am not familiar in detail with any other
different interpretations of this compound. I am aware that Ven.
Ñāṇananda in his “Concept and Reality in Early Buddhist Thought”
addresses this topic to a certain degree and also that Ven. Bhikkhu
Bodhi based his views of the term upon this interpretation[^1] but I,
myself, have never actually read Ven. Ñāṇananda’s book so my view on
this matter will come from perhaps, to some extent, a different angle.

To start with, the respective terms ‘diversification’ and
‘proliferation’ do not deviate from the meaning of
<span lang="pi">*papañca*</span>. According to the PTS dictionary,
<span lang="pi">*papañca*</span> is “expansion, diffuseness,
manifoldedness” or “obstacle, hindrance or delay”. The other members of
the compound are defined as <span lang="pi">*saññā*</span> (perception)
and <span lang="pi">*sankhā*</span> (sign or characteristic). So the
above-mentioned translations would, to some degree, convey the nature of
<span lang="pi">*papañca-saññā-sankhā*</span> quite accurately and, as
Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi says in <cite>The Middle Length Discourses of the
Buddha</cite>[^2] (endnote no. 229, p. 1204-5), “no rendering \[of this
compound\] is utterly beyond doubt”. The question which raises itself
then is not how to etymologically trace the exact roots and origination
of the compound, since such, a task in this case proves impossible in
the absolute sense (and many seem to agree with this). Rather, it is
better to focus and try to find out *within* one’s own experience and
practice what is implied existentially and phenomenologically in the
Suttas by this term.

At the risk of being incomprehensible on some points, I would try to use
‘descriptive’ language, rather than overly technical terms as people’s
general views are already quite firm in regard to such terminology and
it is very likely that they will be coming from a quite different place
than me, probably *too* different which could obstruct them from
understanding what I’m trying to say. In order to reduce this
possibility to a minimum I thought of using some more common terms in my
descriptions which carry less chance of being misunderstood. I hope I
won’t miss the mark too much.

Those familiar with phenomenology and the philosophy of existence should
not have any problems in understanding a statement like all our
experience is intentional or teleological or simply—significant. Each
thing (<span lang="pi">*dhamma*</span>) which is being experienced in
our everyday life has, as its *inherent nature*, to point to other
thing(s), within the experience as a whole. The thing’s significance is
not something ‘steady’ or ‘inchangeable’, although it often might appear
so. The significance of a thing is, rather, something which is being
*acquired* through the *repetition* of the respective experiences of
that very thing. During this, the whole perception of a thing comes to
‘grow’ in a course of time, so to speak, and though there are certainly
significances which are *recognized* as common to all people, at a more
fundamental level they are all *individually* acquired and carried by
each of us[^3].

Without going into greater details let us say that in the Suttas this
intentionality of experience is what is meant by the statement “with the
grain” or <span lang="pi">*anuloma*</span>. Actually, it is probably
better to be more precise and to re-qualify this and say: taking for
granted this intentionality, holding it and appropriating it, makes this
*with* of “with the grain” to appear. In the
<span lang="pi">*arahant’s*</span> case, the ignorance is completely
destroyed, yet the grain still remains, i.e. things *do not* stop
pointing to other things, but this ‘with’ ceases to exist and is being
replaced by ‘against’ as a result of which we get “against the
grain”—<span lang="pi">*patiloma*</span>. What has changed is the
fundamental *direction* of regarding this very *directionality of
experience.* Thus, even in the case of complete liberation things
continue to be teleological or ‘with purpose’ so they still point to
other things and so on. All this is being mentioned for the reason that
the term <span lang="pi">*papañca*</span> is probably too often
misunderstood to simply mean ‘mental proliferation’, ‘when one thinks or
analyzes too much’ or something like that. Although these things do
imply <span lang="pi">*papañca*</span> (or to be more precise ignorance
and desire-and-lust), the above said nevertheless shows us that if
<span lang="pi">*papañca*</span> is anything, it is certainly more
fundamental than that. In support of this we may add that
<span lang="pi">*papañca*</span> is frequently linked with *maññanā*,
‘conceving’ (for which see <cite>Mūlapariyāya Sutta, MN 1</cite>) which
certainly represents the most fundamental ‘occurrence’ in a mind
affected with ignorance. Thus, what <span lang="pi">*papañca*</span>
would imply is nothing less than this very *intentionality* of our
experience and its *tendency* to grow and expand. However this can
happen only when that ‘with’ is present i.e. when the mind is not free
from the bonds of ignorance and when it keeps following things in their
appearance— “…his consciousness flows after the sign of form \[sound,
smell, tastes, touches, thoughts\], is tied and shackled by
gratification in the sign of form, if fettered by the fetter of
gratification…”[^4]. And surely enough it is said that the
<span lang="pi">*arahant*</span> is
<span lang="pi">*nippapañca*</span>—without diversifications, free from
any attachments (<span lang="pi">*upadhi*</span>), free from burden
*accumulated* in the past.

Thus, one’s world (everything which
appears—<span lang="pi">*nāma-rūpa*</span>), expands. One’s views,
desires etc. expand too, yet this should not be understood in a
momentary sense, which would suggest that they will somehow ‘shrink’
afterwards[^5] by themselves. Their *intensity* or the *intensity of
their presence*, once ‘accumulated’ i.e. came to being, is being
‘assumed’ or ‘held’ (<span lang="pi">*upādāna*</span>) at that (new)
face value. When this happens—and it happens through the repetition of
\[ignorant\] actions as said above—consciousness “becomes established”
upon that *degree of presence*, which then becomes the *actual
experience* of that *thing*. Thus, the intensity of experience, that
which appears as <span lang="pi">*nāma-rūpa*</span> grows (for more
details see <cite>Mahānidāna Sutta, DN 15 \[ii,63\]</cite>). This kind
of pattern stretches from the most fundamental levels of our existence
(as seen in Mūlapariyāya Sutta), up to the coarsest ones which we might
say are, “resorting to rods and weapons, of quarrels, brawls, disputes,
recrimination, malicious words and false speech[^6]…”, that is *the
directly painful actions resulting from one’s ignorance*. Thus, based on
the above, <span lang="pi">*papañca*</span> represents the ‘diffusion’
of this fundamental underlying principle with ignorance being
*necessarily present*, and consequently
<span lang="pi">*papañca-saññā-sankhā*</span> are all ‘calculations’ or
‘notions’, perceived and originated as a result of taking this principle
of diffusion for granted i.e. not understanding it.

To conclude, it is worth mentioning that this whole situation would be
much clearer if we can bear in mind Ven. Ñāṇavīra Thera’s description of
the infinite hierarchy of consciousness, the different levels of
generality of
<span lang="pi">*nāma-rūpa*</span>—<span lang="pi">*viññāṇa*</span>.
That is because <span lang="pi">*papañca-saññā-sankhā*</span> is not
something which appears on a voluntary level, as if one could stop it at
any time; it stretches from the most general (reflexive) levels of
existence[^7]. What one is responsible for, in that whole structure, is
“delighting in, welcoming and holding to…” the “source through which
perceptions and notions \[born of\] mental proliferation beset a
man…”[^8]. Thus the hierarchy of signifying things continues to arise
(cease and change-while-standing) but it no longer grows; it is “cut off
at the root, made like a palm stump”. Its root was ignorance in itself
and with its absence everything founded upon it comes to an end—one is
free. In other words the respective experiences of the
<span lang="pi">*puthujjana*</span> and <span lang="pi">*arahant*</span>
alike, share the same fundamental nature of impermanence (arising and
ceasing) but the respective *intensities* of those experiences are
changed; for the <span lang="pi">*arahant*</span> *feeling none* of
it[^9] and for the <span lang="pi">*puthujjana*</span> dependant on the
amount of ignorance being present. More ignorance, more ‘intensity’,
things appear as more ‘pressing’ and one is easily prone to giving in to
desire-and-lust. The arising of things in the
<span lang="pi">*puthujjana’s*</span> mind brings diffusion of
perceptions and notions which, while not understood at its roots, will
in return diffuse further and further and so on. This cannot happen in
the <span lang="pi">*arahant’s*</span> mind any more. His consciousness
has ‘ceased’ so there is nothing to follow and diversify upon this
teleological characteristic of the existential structure, which will
remain only until his aggregates ‘break apart’.

    is enough for becoming an arahant (if there is wisdom, of course).
