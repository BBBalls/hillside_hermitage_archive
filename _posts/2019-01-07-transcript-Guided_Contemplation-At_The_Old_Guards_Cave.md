Meditation/<span lang="pi">*Bhāvanā*</span>, the mental development that
the Buddha taught, is about the cultivation of understanding or wisdom.
A practitioner, therefore, should not be looking for some kind of
special novelty experience, but instead should be looking for clarity in
terms of understanding, which if done rightly, will result in freedom
from suffering and peace.

It doesn’t matter if you meditate for 10-15 minutes or a dedicated five
hours a day. What matters is that that time is spent towards
establishing the mind in clarity in regard to the nature of experience,
i.e developing wisdom. That’s also why instruction is necessary. If you
don’t know what to look for, if you don’t know what to discern, you
won’t find it by yourself. Even as far as a ‘guided meditation’ goes, it
should be guiding you towards understanding.

Let’s say that a person wants to settle their mind, without falling into
some kind of mystical absorption, and without over rationalising either,
the first thing that needs to be done is physical solitude, being
physically removed from other people. Far enough to not hear them, far
enough to not see them, far enough to not feel that you can be
encroached upon by them at any given time. Secluded and remote. Once you
are secluded and remote, ask yourself, “What is the goal of the
practice? What is my specific purpose? What am I trying to achieve? Am I
after happiness? Am I after peace? Am I after freedom from suffering?”
Whatever the answer may be, it should be made clear that the experience
of peace or happiness, etc, will not be given to you. That experience
needs to be cultivated and you can only develop that peace, freedom from
suffering, happiness and wisdom by knowing how you’re supposed to
develop it. That is why the Buddha said, a person should go and visit
those who are wise. Then reflect upon what he has heard and measure the
task.

All the tools for freedom from suffering are already contained within
your experiences as a whole, within the five aggregates. As the Buddha
said, the reason for suffering is craving, and the reason for freedom
from suffering is the extinguishing of craving. Craving is not to be
found elsewhere. It’s not in things you crave for. It’s not in things
you’re attached to. It’s not in things that you find dear and pleasing.
It’s not in the world. It’s not in the object of your senses. It’s not
in the object of your attention. It’s in your attitude towards things
that you can attend, perceive and engage with. If you were to remove
that craving, gradually, if you were to stop feeding it, if you were to
allow it to fade away through non-maintenance. Then the result is
freedom from suffering within this very present experience as a whole.
Right now.

That non-maintenance is developed and discerned when you realise that
you can’t maintain it, even if you want to, when you realise that the
very foundation of your own life is not in your own control, you have no
say in it, your life is secondary to it, your choices that you’ve been
making are secondary to it. And that’s nothing other than impermanence
that the Buddha was talking about.

Once you have gone to a secluded place, away from people, it will take
some time for the mind to settle into that solitude. Whenever that is,
without overdoing it, without over attending it, try to start regarding
yourself as part of that non-inhabited setup, for example, being a part
of that remote forest, cave, root of the tree, the empty hut, wherever
you might be. There are trees, there are rocks, there are rivers, there
are waterfalls, there is this body there as well. There are monkeys,
there are birds, there are snakes, there is this body there as well. You
are not separate from it. There is this cave here, the huge tree trunks,
broken trees, broken rocks, mountains and so on. Your body is actually
‘closer’ to those things than to your point of view. Your body belongs
to these rocks and trees and forests, mountains and so on ‘belongs’ as
in, it is made of the same elements. The whole ‘your’ of ‘your body’, is
completely gratuitous. The only reason you can regard your body as yours
is because there is something to be regarded as mine. And that something
precedes your ownership, and that’s what you’re either reminding
yourself of or discerning for the first time, doesn’t matter. The
solitary setup, free from people, free from disturbances where you are
alone, you start to see that your own point of view is incidental in the
grand scheme of things, the grand scheme of things of the entire four
great elements, the mountains, the forests that you are in. Your body
shares that nature, your body is the same. Which means as huge as these
rocks are, you can see that even they break down, split and crumble.
What then is to be said about this human body which is quite soft in
comparison. If the granite mountains cannot escape the gradual
destruction what is to be said about this very soft body.

Such a thought is not for the purpose of some kind of poetic indulgence.
No, these reflections are about undermining your very own sense of
existence, which is your very own sense of control, mastery and
ownership. And it’s not necessarily going to be pleasant, especially not
if it’s discerned for the first time. These things are frightening for
those who still want to hold on to their appropriated point of view, as
the owner of the body and so on. That’s why you have to ‘learn’ how to
find peace in it. It’s not really an option. Fear is optional. You don’t
have to fear it. But you will automatically fear it. If it contradicts
your point of view of ownership, which you’re refusing to let go of. You
have to gradually undermine your own sense of ownership whereby, even
the fear cannot be owned. But you do have to accept it first.

So this very body, six feet tall, surrounded by wilderness, belongs to
the wilderness, that belongs to the great planet earth, that belongs to
a complete set of its own laws and circumstances and accidents, and
change of elements and so on. Which means not even a tiny grain of this
human body can be mine or can obey me. The beating heart, the muscle
that pumps the blood completely involuntarily, is like these rivers
flowing here, the trees growing and so on, but if something little
changes, those great things will be gone. What is to say, for a little
inferior, tiny muscle in your chest, that pumps blood that keeps you
alive. Or your lungs being able to breathe, the movement of the wind in
this forest, the movement of the wind on the mountain, the movement of
the wind within this body.

That’s why the Buddha would talk about these things in the suttas,
because you are to reflect on it so that you actually ‘feel’ that ‘not
in control’. That’s why virtue needs to be established beforehand, you
must have been living restrained and keeping the precepts, because if
you start undermining your own sense of self, your own point of view,
which is all about control and mastery, well, you start undermining your
sanity, very often, not always, but very often because that fear can
overwhelm a person. However, it can’t overwhelm you, if your behaviour
has been purified beforehand.

By dwelling in the solitary environment, free from others, you actually
get to see that whatever personality, whatever sense of self you have
created in the course of this life, it’s fully dependent upon this
living operating organs of this body, that are on the level of trees,
rocks, rivers, mountains, and so on. And when those things come to
cease, these organs will also come to cease, they cannot possibly remain
standing. So it’s not a question of looking for a great epiphany or some
great revelation of the hidden truth, it’s a question of clarifying this
very image, this very reflection, maintaining it and letting it endure,
letting it exist peripherally (at the back of your mind so to speak)
while you are doing other things. Establish your mind in it, because
you’re basically establishing your mind in non-appropriation, you’re
establishing your mind in the impossibility of appropriation.

If you are in a forest, take a look at all the twigs and branches there,
you don’t think twice about them. If somebody were to ask, “Is this
yours? Does this belong to you?” The answer is “No, of course not.” But
if somebody were to ask you about your own body, you’d say, “Well, it is
my body”, or you might stop and think about it, “…but it isn’t mine, in
the same manner, these objects around me aren’t mine in this
wilderness.” This circumstantial forest, your body, shares the same
nature. None of this is yours and therefore that body cannot be yours
because if it were yours, you would be in charge of your own heart, the
way it beats, you could tell it to stop, you would be in charge of your
own metabolism, your own lungs, brain, and so on. But you aren’t. Any
notion of control intentionality and choice that comes through it is
secondary, it’s fully within the container of this given body. Which
means when that given body ceases to be given to you, all the things
that you do on account of it will not be able to stand anymore.

Seclusion, in order to stop identifying yourself, with people, with
external sense of control with external sense of management, but
instead, as a stepping back into something greater, something more
accidental, something that cannot be conceived to be controlled. Such as
wilderness, and then maintaining that image, that meaning. Not expecting
a great bolt of lightning, giving you every answer to every single
question. No, just maintaining that very setup, because that very setup
will be puncturing the bubble of craving, and it will slowly bleed away.
That’s what I meant by non maintenance of it, you can’t stop maintaining
it overnight. But you set up an environment that prevents it, that
cannot give rise to maintenance of craving of one’s own appropriation.
And that’s how craving bleeds out, fades away, then even if you’re with
people afterwards, there will not be the re-induction of your own
ignorance and your own appropriation.

These giant roots, massive rocks, huge banyan trees, great mountains,
large rivers. All that is accidental, circumstantial. What is to be said
about the blood flowing in this body, the heart pumping and the lungs
breathing. Even the small trees and branches are more durable than this
body, yet somehow this body is regarded as mine, as if it is in my
control. It’s not about denying your sense of control, it’s about
undermining it while it is still present, by seeing it as gratuitous.

There is me, there is this sense of I am, but you want to undermine it,
by seeing it fully determined by that which cannot be yours. That’s how
your own sense of control ceases to be yours. That’s how an arahant can
still act, talk, choose, prefer, without actually owning anything,
because he has fully surpassed and surmounted it. The only reason people
appropriate things is because they don’t fully understand that they
cannot do so. I mean, I can say, “yes, this mountain is mine”, but it’s
completely meaningless. It’s even meaningless to me. I know it’s
meaningless, and there is no amount of self induced conviction that will
make me believe “No, it is mine”. It cannot be mine. I can say that
“This planet earth is mine”. Sure, but that statement is hollow, and
it’s not more hollow than saying that this body is mine. It isn’t. It’s
absolutely on the same footing as the element of earth. And if that is
discerned, then it will be equally meaningless for you to think that
this body, this heart, these lungs, these senses are mine. And then
there will be no problem left for you to deal with, because you have
surmounted, let go of, extinguished the basis of all problems. You don’t
go around dealing with every single problem individually. You just
uproot the necessary basis for all problems.
