<h2 id="hh--guided-contemplation---at-the-old-guards-cave">51hh- Guided
Contemplation - At The Old Guards Cave</h2>
<p>Meditation/<em>Bhāvanā</em>, the mental development that the Buddha
taught, is about the cultivation of understanding or wisdom. A
practitioner, therefore, should not be looking for some kind of special
novelty experience, but instead should be looking for clarity in terms
of understanding, which if done rightly, will result in freedom from
suffering and peace.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you meditate for 10-15 minutes or a dedicated
five hours a day. What matters is that that time is spent towards
establishing the mind in clarity in regard to the nature of experience,
i.e developing wisdom. That’s also why instruction is necessary. If you
don’t know what to look for, if you don’t know what to discern, you
won’t find it by yourself. Even as far as a ‘guided meditation’ goes, it
should be guiding you towards understanding.</p>
<p>Let’s say that a person wants to settle their mind, without falling
into some kind of mystical absorption, and without over rationalising
either, the first thing that needs to be done is physical solitude,
being physically removed from other people. Far enough to not hear them,
far enough to not see them, far enough to not feel that you can be
encroached upon by them at any given time. Secluded and remote. Once you
are secluded and remote, ask yourself, “What is the goal of the
practice? What is my specific purpose? What am I trying to achieve? Am I
after happiness? Am I after peace? Am I after freedom from suffering?”
Whatever the answer may be, it should be made clear that the experience
of peace or happiness, etc, will not be given to you. That experience
needs to be cultivated and you can only develop that peace, freedom from
suffering, happiness and wisdom by knowing how you’re supposed to
develop it. That is why the Buddha said, a person should go and visit
those who are wise. Then reflect upon what he has heard and measure the
task.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Bhikkhus, I do not say that final knowledge is achieved all at once.
On the contrary, final knowledge is achieved by gradual training, by
gradual practice, by gradual progress.</p>
<p>“And how is final knowledge achieved by gradual training, gradual
practice, gradual progress? Here one who has faith in a teacher visits
him; when he visits him, he pays respect to him; when he pays respect to
him, he gives ear; one who gives ear hears the Dhamma; having heard the
Dhamma, he memorises it; he examines the meaning of the teachings he has
memorised; when he examines their meaning, he gains a reflective
acceptance of those teachings; when he has gained a reflective
acceptance of those teachings, zeal springs up in him; when zeal has
sprung up, he applies his will; having applied his will, he scrutinises;
having scrutinised, he strives; resolutely striving, he realises with
the body the supreme truth and sees it by penetrating it with
wisdom.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

</blockquote>
<p>All the tools for freedom from suffering are already contained within
your experiences as a whole, within the five aggregates. As the Buddha
said, the reason for suffering is craving, and the reason for freedom
from suffering is the extinguishing of craving. Craving is not to be
found elsewhere. It’s not in things you crave for. It’s not in things
you’re attached to. It’s not in things that you find dear and pleasing.
It’s not in the world. It’s not in the object of your senses. It’s not
in the object of your attention. It’s in your attitude towards things
that you can attend, perceive and engage with. If you were to remove
that craving, gradually, if you were to stop feeding it, if you were to
allow it to fade away through non-maintenance. Then the result is
freedom from suffering within this very present experience as a whole.
Right now.</p>
<p>That non-maintenance is developed and discerned when you realise that
you can’t maintain it, even if you want to, when you realise that the
very foundation of your own life is not in your own control, you have no
say in it, your life is secondary to it, your choices that you’ve been
making are secondary to it. And that’s nothing other than impermanence
that the Buddha was talking about.</p>
<p>Once you have gone to a secluded place, away from people, it will
take some time for the mind to settle into that solitude. Whenever that
is, without overdoing it, without over attending it, try to start
regarding yourself as part of that non-inhabited setup, for example,
being a part of that remote forest, cave, root of the tree, the empty
hut, wherever you might be. There are trees, there are rocks, there are
rivers, there are waterfalls, there is this body there as well. There
are monkeys, there are birds, there are snakes, there is this body there
as well. You are not separate from it. There is this cave here, the huge
tree trunks, broken trees, broken rocks, mountains and so on. Your body
is actually ‘closer’ to those things than to your point of view. Your
body belongs to these rocks and trees and forests, mountains and so on
‘belongs’ as in, it is made of the same elements. The whole ‘your’ of
‘your body’, is completely gratuitous. The only reason you can regard
your body as yours is because there is something to be regarded as mine.
And that something precedes your ownership, and that’s what you’re
either reminding yourself of or discerning for the first time, doesn’t
matter. The solitary setup, free from people, free from disturbances
where you are alone, you start to see that your own point of view is
incidental in the grand scheme of things, the grand scheme of things of
the entire four great elements, the mountains, the forests that you are
in. Your body shares that nature, your body is the same. Which means as
huge as these rocks are, you can see that even they break down, split
and crumble. What then is to be said about this human body which is
quite soft in comparison. If the granite mountains cannot escape the
gradual destruction what is to be said about this very soft body.</p>
<p>Such a thought is not for the purpose of some kind of poetic
indulgence. No, these reflections are about undermining your very own
sense of existence, which is your very own sense of control, mastery and
ownership. And it’s not necessarily going to be pleasant, especially not
if it’s discerned for the first time. These things are frightening for
those who still want to hold on to their appropriated point of view, as
the owner of the body and so on. That’s why you have to ‘learn’ how to
find peace in it. It’s not really an option. Fear is optional. You don’t
have to fear it. But you will automatically fear it. If it contradicts
your point of view of ownership, which you’re refusing to let go of. You
have to gradually undermine your own sense of ownership whereby, even
the fear cannot be owned. But you do have to accept it first.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“What, friends, is the earth element? The earth element may be either
internal or external. What is the internal earth element? Whatever
internally, belonging to oneself, is solid, solidified, and
appropriated; that is, head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin,
flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm,
spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, contents of the stomach, feces, or
whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is solid, solidified,
and appropriated: this is called the internal earth element. Now both
the internal earth element and the external earth element are simply
earth element. And that should be seen as it actually is with proper
wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’
When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom, one becomes
disenchanted with the earth element and makes the mind dispassionate
toward the earth element.</p>
<p>“Now there comes a time when the water element is disturbed and then
the external earth element vanishes. When even this external earth
element, great as it is, is seen to be impermanent, subject to
destruction, disappearance, and changeˌ what of this body, which is
appropriated by craving and lasts but a while? There can be no
consideration of that as ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘I am.’”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>– <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn28">MN 28</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this very body, six feet tall, surrounded by wilderness, belongs
to the wilderness, that belongs to the great planet earth, that belongs
to a complete set of its own laws and circumstances and accidents, and
change of elements and so on. Which means not even a tiny grain of this
human body can be mine or can obey me. The beating heart, the muscle
that pumps the blood completely involuntarily, is like these rivers
flowing here, the trees growing and so on, but if something little
changes, those great things will be gone. What is to say, for a little
inferior, tiny muscle in your chest, that pumps blood that keeps you
alive. Or your lungs being able to breathe, the movement of the wind in
this forest, the movement of the wind on the mountain, the movement of
the wind within this body.</p>
<p>That’s why the Buddha would talk about these things in the suttas,
because you are to reflect on it so that you actually ‘feel’ that ‘not
in control’. That’s why virtue needs to be established beforehand, you
must have been living restrained and keeping the precepts, because if
you start undermining your own sense of self, your own point of view,
which is all about control and mastery, well, you start undermining your
sanity, very often, not always, but very often because that fear can
overwhelm a person. However, it can’t overwhelm you, if your behaviour
has been purified beforehand.</p>
<p>By dwelling in the solitary environment, free from others, you
actually get to see that whatever personality, whatever sense of self
you have created in the course of this life, it’s fully dependent upon
this living operating organs of this body, that are on the level of
trees, rocks, rivers, mountains, and so on. And when those things come
to cease, these organs will also come to cease, they cannot possibly
remain standing. So it’s not a question of looking for a great epiphany
or some great revelation of the hidden truth, it’s a question of
clarifying this very image, this very reflection, maintaining it and
letting it endure, letting it exist peripherally (at the back of your
mind so to speak) while you are doing other things. Establish your mind
in it, because you’re basically establishing your mind in
non-appropriation, you’re establishing your mind in the impossibility of
appropriation.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Suppose, bhikkhus, people were to carry off the grass, sticks,
branches, and foliage in this Jeta’s Grove, or to burn them, or to do
with them as they wish. Would you think: ‘People are carrying us off, or
burning us, or doing with us as they wish’?”</p>
<p>“No, venerable sir. For what reason? Because, venerable sir, that is
neither our self nor what belongs to our self.”</p>
<p>“So too, bhikkhus, form is not yours,
feeling…,perception…,intentions…,consciousness is not yours: abandon it.
When you have abandoned it, that will lead to your welfare and
happiness.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>– <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.33">SN 22.33</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are in a forest, take a look at all the twigs and branches
there, you don’t think twice about them. If somebody were to ask, “Is
this yours? Does this belong to you?” The answer is “No, of course not.”
But if somebody were to ask you about your own body, you’d say, “Well,
it is my body”, or you might stop and think about it, “…but it isn’t
mine, in the same manner, these objects around me aren’t mine in this
wilderness.” This circumstantial forest, your body, shares the same
nature. None of this is yours and therefore that body cannot be yours
because if it were yours, you would be in charge of your own heart, the
way it beats, you could tell it to stop, you would be in charge of your
own metabolism, your own lungs, brain, and so on. But you aren’t. Any
notion of control intentionality and choice that comes through it is
secondary, it’s fully within the container of this given body. Which
means when that given body ceases to be given to you, all the things
that you do on account of it will not be able to stand anymore.</p>
<p>Seclusion, in order to stop identifying yourself, with people, with
external sense of control with external sense of management, but
instead, as a stepping back into something greater, something more
accidental, something that cannot be conceived to be controlled. Such as
wilderness, and then maintaining that image, that meaning. Not expecting
a great bolt of lightning, giving you every answer to every single
question. No, just maintaining that very setup, because that very setup
will be puncturing the bubble of craving, and it will slowly bleed away.
That’s what I meant by non maintenance of it, you can’t stop maintaining
it overnight. But you set up an environment that prevents it, that
cannot give rise to maintenance of craving of one’s own appropriation.
And that’s how craving bleeds out, fades away, then even if you’re with
people afterwards, there will not be the re-induction of your own
ignorance and your own appropriation.</p>
<p>These giant roots, massive rocks, huge banyan trees, great mountains,
large rivers. All that is accidental, circumstantial. What is to be said
about the blood flowing in this body, the heart pumping and the lungs
breathing. Even the small trees and branches are more durable than this
body, yet somehow this body is regarded as mine, as if it is in my
control. It’s not about denying your sense of control, it’s about
undermining it while it is still present, by seeing it as
gratuitous.</p>
<p>There is me, there is this sense of I am, but you want to undermine
it, by seeing it fully determined by that which cannot be yours. That’s
how your own sense of control ceases to be yours. That’s how an arahant
can still act, talk, choose, prefer, without actually owning anything,
because he has fully surpassed and surmounted it. The only reason people
appropriate things is because they don’t fully understand that they
cannot do so. I mean, I can say, “yes, this mountain is mine”, but it’s
completely meaningless. It’s even meaningless to me. I know it’s
meaningless, and there is no amount of self induced conviction that will
make me believe “No, it is mine”. It cannot be mine. I can say that
“This planet earth is mine”. Sure, but that statement is hollow, and
it’s not more hollow than saying that this body is mine. It isn’t. It’s
absolutely on the same footing as the element of earth. And if that is
discerned, then it will be equally meaningless for you to think that
this body, this heart, these lungs, these senses are mine. And then
there will be no problem left for you to deal with, because you have
surmounted, let go of, extinguished the basis of all problems. You don’t
go around dealing with every single problem individually. You just
uproot the necessary basis for all problems.</p>
<h2 id="hh--not-wanting-the-wanting">54hh- Not Wanting the Wanting</h2>
<p>Wanting sense objects that you derive pleasure from, that is
sensuality, it’s that wanting. So, in order to abandon sensuality, you
have to stop being concerned with the objects that you want and start
developing ‘not wanting’ of that wanting of the sense objects. Of
course, restraint needs to be done first and then, on the basis of that,
you can start discerning the nature of wanting anything sensual.</p>
<p>As long as you remain focussed on the objects that you want, you are
then failing to see the root of sensuality, but consequently, if you
develop ‘not wanting’ in regard to that wanting of sense objects, that’s
how you overcome the sense objects. You lose concern with them because
you uprooted them, through developing ‘not wanting’ of their
wanting.</p>
<p>Sensuality is the wanting of sensual objects, welcoming,
entertaining, delighting in them. That would be your wanting and
accepting of that wanting of sense objects at face value. A skilled
monk, a person who practises correctly, will then first be restrained
and then start seeing that it’s the wanting that’s the problem.</p>
<p>Through not welcoming, entertaining or delighting in the wanting of
sensual objects, you surmount the whole domain of sensuality.</p>
<p>That’s what I mean when I say develop the ‘not wanting’ of sensual
objects, that’s what ‘don’t delight’ means. A person who doesn’t see
this will either be concerned with sensual objects, denying them, saying
it’s impermanent or ugly, basically misapplying his effort towards sense
objects, or failing to see that they are rooted in ‘being wanted’ that
is the problem. But then equally he will then try to override that
initial wanting of sensual objects, try to get rid of it, try to prevent
it from arising, but you can’t do that because the arising is not in
you.</p>
<p>As the Buddha said, “the eye wants to see pleasant sights etc” –
that’s just the structure of your experience. That’s how the five senses
operate, that’s why the Buddha referred to them as five feeding grounds.
So, trying to interfere with that wanting of sense objects is also
taking it up.</p>
<p>Not delighting does not mean that you deny that first arising, it
means you see it as a whole, or you see that there are the sense objects
that are being wanted by the senses and that’s what you don’t delight
in. If wanting of sensuality has arisen, it’s going to persist on its
own as an arisen dhamma, as an arisen phenomena for as long as it
persists. Your only concern is to not delight in it for any time during
its duration.</p>
<p>If somebody arrives in front of your door and wants to come in, the
only way for them to enter is if you welcome them in. So in the
beginning you might feel awkward, pressured and nervous because the
person is in front of your door and you either go out to welcome him in
out of weakness etc, but then you realize that you can’t let him in – he
can stand there for hundreds of years if he wants, that’s not your
concern. Your concern is to not welcome him inside. If you start
practising like that, things will go away of their own accord. The
Mara’s daughters, they are going to try and harass you for as long as
they perceive a way in, a possibility of being allowed to come inside.
When they tried with the Buddha, after his enlightenment, they could not
get in because he had been practising for years. For a person who hasn’t
been practising, it’s then enough for someone to come and stand at the
door and that person will cave in and start engaging with them, because
of the uncomfortable pressure.</p>
<p>All one has to do is keep the door closed, not try to chase anyone
away because that would be engaging with them. Affirming or denying,
either way, you are engaged with things. So, the only way to not engage
is to allow a thing to arise, whichever way it arises and then not
welcome it. Don’t open the door, and if you do that to the extent
necessary, with the passage of time, it will stop coming.</p>
<p>As some suttas say “you establish your mind in the imperturbable in
regard to sensuality”. It doesn’t matter what arises, one is not
concerned with the content, you just maintain the attitude of not
wanting the arisen wanting of these sense objects. If you do that long
enough then the arising of the wanting of sense objects will change its
significance. It’s not going to be about sense objects anymore, it’s
going to be about “oh, this is that which is not welcomed or delighted
in, this is that which is not wanted, this is that which used to be my
sensuality”. Even wanting the absence of those things is taking up the
wanting. The significance changes while the objects remain the same and
the whole domain remains the same. The eyes still have their feeding
ground, but now you have conquered them, now they can’t go feed like the
wild animals used to do, you are now the one in control. So, the eye
will get to eat only what the mind that doesn’t want any of it allows,
and whatever it allows, it won’t be a sensual thing. Because that has
been abandoned.</p>
<p>Sensuality requires taking that wanting for granted. That’s why if
you stop wanting the wanting of sense objects, you get to see the extent
of the wanting in regard to the sense objects, you get to understand the
gratification. By seeing that, you get to understand the danger of the
wanting of sense objects. If you say ‘yes’ to the wanting of pleasant
sights and then within the next 10 seconds you go blind, or those sights
are ripped away from you, would you be affected? Of course you would,
but if you never give in to the original wanting of those sights, would
you then be affected? You wouldn’t, because you never took on that
wanting, you never welcomed it in. Like the simile of the mango tree….
(MN 54)</p>
<p>That directionality of wanting the sense objects is always
directional, as in it’s always going to take you one way or another,
which means that you can’t maintain the perspective of the domain – you
have to commit to it and go with it, which means that you are not in
control. It’s all great when things are going the way you want, but it’s
inconceivable that that’s how things will always be. Not just from the
side of your own senses failing, but also the objects as well. Just ask
yourself, which is more? The times I got what I wanted or the times I
didn’t, and you realise, of course, it’s the times I didn’t get what I
wanted is more. So, whenever I got what I wanted, it was circumstantial,
accidental – the bases of usually not getting what I wanted.</p>
<p>If you stop wanting any type of wanting of the sense objects, you
cannot not get what you want, because you only want one thing –
non-sensuality and now that is implied in sensuality. Sensuality keeps
reminding you of your freedom from sensuality. Sense objects keep
reminding you of your imperturbable state.</p>
<p>One needs to understand what sensuality is, which is the wanting of
the sense objects, not just the wanting or just the sense objects. It’s
the wanting of these pleasing sights etc, it’s this pressure I
experience on the level of my body, on the level of my senses.</p>
<p>So, you stop wanting the wanting, which means that you will also have
to stop being concerned with the object of your sensuality, but start
looking at the nature of sensuality which is ‘it being wanted’. So, you
don’t want that which is being wanted in regard to the senses. What you
will then get is unshakeable peace or freedom from suffering.</p>
<p>Sensuality is inherently unpleasant, it’s dangerous, it’s of very
little gratification, it’s not worth even making the effort for the
gratification. It’s like someone asking you for $1000 for a lottery
ticket which has a maximum win of $5 – it’s ridiculous. Why would you do
that, yet that’s what sensuality is. Even with the most refined type of
sensuality, the utmost reward that you will get is always 100th of your
investment. That’s why the Buddha gave the simile of sensuality being
like a meatless bone that a dog keeps chewing because it’s just mad with
it, he gets nothing in return. It’s of little gratification not because
you theoretically pondered over it and you mused how unsatisfactory it
is – no, it’s a fact, that’s the deal you always get. All you need to do
is not invest in sensuality and you will gain a thousand-fold. All you
need is to practise renunciation to win.</p>
<p>All you need to do is not do sensuality and you win. That’s the
pleasure of jhāna – the pleasure of relief from the burden.</p>
<p>With sensuality, it’s not just that you do not get any reward – you
lose even more. By contrast, renunciation is loss and debt-free.</p>
<p>You cannot understand the nature of sensuality correctly and still
want it, the two are mutually exclusive. Understanding of it means not
wanting it. People engage in sensuality because that’s the only pleasure
they know. That’s not necessarily the problem, you use the same
criteria, ‘I want pleasure’, the senses want pleasure. That’s fine, but
it’s about what pleasure you pursue with this, that’s the difference,
and that’s what the Buddha realized – that there is nothing unwholesome
with the pleasure of jhāna or renunciation.</p>
<p>So, from the point of view of ‘wanting the pleasure of the senses’,
you will get more pleasure through restraining than sensuality.</p>
<p>That’s why sensuality and carelessness go hand-in-hand. You need to
be careless and lose sight of the perspective in order to be pulled by
sensuality and give in. But everybody starts by being careless and being
sensual within the sensual domain. So, you start with restraint in order
to develop the perspective of it – then you can say ‘no’ to the right
things.</p>
<p>That’s why sensuality is not wanted by anyone, and not discerning
that, you habitually go with that arisen ‘wanting of your senses’. You
appropriate it and then you think that you want it. So, you don’t deny
the sense objects or the wanting of them, but you say ‘no’ to them and
let them endure without giving in at any point of the duration. Then you
realise the pain here, that the unpleasant aspect is the aspect of the
sense of suffering on account of not getting the object, but neither of
that is mine, and then eventually those senses will calm down. Like the
taming of the wild animal ’simile… (SN 35:247)</p>
<p>If that’s not working in someone’s practice, they are probably
denying ‘the wanting of the sense objects’, as in interfering with it,
or are too concerned with denying the sense objects themselves. Which
means they don’t have the perspective of the nature of the sensual
domain, but if they do, they realise that that domain has arisen on its
own. Sensuality is there – eyes want to see etc., don’t interfere with
that. Don’t be careless in regard to that.</p>
<p>Not wanting the wanting of sense objects needs to be universal, that
attitude needs to be developed so you say “This is not just for today or
tomorrow that I don’t want this, this is for the rest of my life and
future lives if that might happen”. The wanting of the sense objects
will never be wanted, will never be welcomed. It might arise countless
times more for you, but every time it arises, it is not welcomed and you
won’t open the door until eventually it will have to go away. Either
way, you will win, you will win by not being bothered, by not losing
your investments stupidly, by not exposing yourself to risk and then, on
top of that, by discerning the nature of the imperturbable, which is
immeasurably more pleasurable in a wholesome sense. You can’t even
compare it to the pleasure of sensuality. They are two different
domains, they are mutually exclusive. You can’t have jhāna and have
sensuality. Through discerning and abandoning the sensual domain, you
develop the impenetrable in regard to that domain, that’s the pleasure
of jhānas. Welcoming the possibility of sensuality in the future will
keep sensuality pressuring you. Reaching the state of freedom from
sensuality depends on your power of conviction.</p>
<h2 id="hh--overcoming-anxiety">63hh- Overcoming Anxiety</h2>
<p>How do I overcome anxiety? That’s something everybody will wonder
about at some point in their life and probably for many people today,
it’s quite a pressing issue. The first necessary step and thing to
realize is that you need to stop resisting or trying to get rid of that
anxiety.</p>
<p>It’s good that you see anxiety as a problem so that you don’t just go
around trying to ignore or forget about it through engaging with
sensuality, but at the same time, you do have to understand the
difference between - wanting to be free from anxiety in the long run and
trying to get rid of it immediately, right here and now. That pressing
and impatient need of removing it as soon as it arises or as soon as it
starts arising is what makes it so much more unpleasant. If you stop
trying to get rid of it, then you will be able to see it for what it is.
And what it is, is that it’s not a problem that has arisen on account of
a mistake. It’s a mirroring of the very basic, very primordial,
existential principle or an existential discrepancy which is that this
life of mine, my own life, my environment, it’s not my own, in a sense
that fundamentally things upon which my life rests, things that
determine my life are not in my control.</p>
<p><strong>The Existential Discrepancy</strong></p>
<p>Anxiety is just a revelation of the most certain thing when it comes
down to your existence. And that thing is that your existence is not in
your control, which doesn’t mean that your choices are not in your
control, but means that choices are already within that existence that
you have no say in. You have no say in the fundamental aspects of your
environment, in the circumstances that can affect your life, you can
only do the best you can within that limited amount of control that you
are given. But if you look at it closely, fundamentally no amount of
control can ever change or upturn that order and truly make you the
master of your own experience, of your own life. Why? Because
fundamentally, the fact that you’re going to be subjected to elements,
to adverse change or positive change, the fact that that remains there
as something you’re fundamentally and utterly subjected to. That’s
exactly what anxiety reveals. It reveals the discrepancy between the
assumption of your world and the actual nature of it.</p>
<p>That’s also why anxiety is unpleasant. If you were to remove the
discrepancy, if you were to remove the view that believes that you are
the master of your feelings, for example, then that will remove the
unpleasant aspect of anxiety and then anxiety will not be anxiety as you
know it, it would simply be a recognition of the fundamental principle
of life, which is “it is not in your control”, “it cannot be yours”. By
that I mean you cannot be the owner because if you were truly the owner,
the life, the feelings would obey you. You would feel only what you want
to feel. You will experience only what you want to experience. But the
fact that that is simply not possible, you end up living your life at
odds with the very nature of it. Your attitude towards your feelings,
pleasure, displeasure, or neutral, is at odds with the actual nature of
those feelings. They arise on their own, they manifest themselves to
you. And that’s where the problem arises whereby, when pleasant feelings
manifest themselves to you, you want them and you feel fully entitled in
doing so, you feel fully entitled in going after them. You feel fully
entitled in entertaining them, building your decisions or choices upon
them, and so on. And then when you have a disagreeable feeling arise,
you equally feel fully entitled to try to get rid of it right away
thinking, “I must not be feeling this, I should not be feeling this”. So
when it comes to such a subtle, overwhelming yet so general experience
of unpleasant anxiety, the first thing is to stop acting out of that
sense of, “I have a right to not want this”. Whatever has arisen, it has
arisen on its own, be it this feeling, or that feeling, which means your
‘rights’ stop there, so to speak. You have a right to choose this or
that, you have a right to take responsibility for your choices. But you
don’t have a right to not feel this, because whatever is being felt,
it’s felt based on this life that’s subjected to feelings.</p>
<p><strong>Removal Of The Wrong View</strong></p>
<p>It’s not about freeing yourself from the unpleasant feeling, it’s
about freeing yourself from the view that you impose upon the very
present experience that you have that then results in this disparity
felt as anxious suffering. You can’t get rid of that view overnight. You
can’t just suddenly shift your view and be free from everything that
bothers you. ‘View’ is like a habit of perceiving things a certain way.
So now you need to reprogram the way you perceive things. And you can do
so when you start following the principles for reprogramming and not
just continually act out when things are unpleasant, and then when the
unpleasant anxiety is gone, you forget about it and pretend like it was
never there and your life is fine.</p>
<p>There’s no such thing as ‘a fine life’, as in there is no such thing
as normal life free from anxiety or suffering. There is no such thing as
a life that doesn’t require taking up responsibility. That doesn’t
require work. That’s not optional. What is optional is how you’re going
to go about it. Are you going to try and mask the fact that anxiety
reveals to you the most fundamental nature of your existence, that
you’re not in your control, that your life is not in your control? Are
you going to try to pretend it’s not there by distracting yourself with
sensual pleasures? Or are you going to start accepting responsibility
for it and start looking at it?</p>
<p>By taking responsibility for it and not hiding away, you will still
sometimes feel overwhelmed and uncomfortable. And that’s pretty much
because most of your habits are still concerned with running away and
not accepting it. So it’s gonna take time to be able to accept it. And
once you do, then you will realize that the unpleasant aspect of
anxiety, it’s not necessary. Anxiety in itself is a revelation of that
discrepancy, an insight into the uncertainty of existence. That
uncomfortable insight is absolutely fine. That’s just how it is. You
remove the discrepancy, you remove that displeasure of that anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance or Acceptance</strong></p>
<p>A good starting point is to stop expecting an overnight solution and
stop trying to get rid of it. That’s the most important. And if you have
thoughts of how great things would be without this anxiety, you can use
that as a motivation to make the effort to understand anxiety, but don’t
use that as a justification to want to get rid of it. Because the
notions you have of how great it will be to be anxiety free are just
fantasies. If life was in your control and the way you think it is.
Anxiety would be inconceivable. But the fact that it isn’t, the fact
that it has arisen, the fact that you’re experiencing it means now you
have an option, you’re either going to pretend that that’s a mistake or
you’re going to start looking into your attitude towards your own life
and realize that that’s the bit that needs changing.</p>
<p>As I said, anxiety is a symptom of a problem, it’s not the problem
itself. It reveals the discrepancy that you generate and maintain with
your attitude towards your existence. It’s not the problem of your
existence. Existence itself is not a problem. The problem arises when
there is a discrepancy and when there is a certain disparity. And that’s
what normal is. Normal life is the life based upon that disparity, based
on a contradiction. And that’s why normal life requires constant
engagement and maintenance to cover the fact that it is not your own.
That’s also why people are afraid of solitude. The fear of solitude, for
example, just starts pointing you back towards that which you’re running
away from with your daily distractions, actions, projects and meanings,
and so on. When you’re alone, you’re just left with your thoughts and
what’s going to show itself first is going to be boredom, then it’s
going to be dread and anxiety, because your whole life is about covering
that up, constantly floating on the surface so as not to experience
what’s underneath.</p>
<p>If existence were perfect, if existence is the way you think it is,
then no unpleasant things would be conceivable. Anxiety and displeasure
would be inconceivable. Why? Because you would be the master of your
experience and things will be corresponding to that mastery, your
choices, your feelings, your intentions, which means there will be no
discrepancy to be felt as displeasure.</p>
<p><strong>Reprogramming</strong></p>
<p>So it comes down to changing your view regarding your existence.
Upgrading it, because it is an upgrade. Once you become aware of the
problem, once you become aware of the anxiety, that means you become
aware, unwillingly, of the essential aspect of your own life. And it’s
very unpleasant, not in itself but it’s unpleasant because of your
assumptions regarding your own life that are at odds with it.</p>
<p>Stopping to try and get rid of the anxiety is the first step. The
second step is to start looking at it as a symptom of a problem, not as
the problem itself, not as something I must deal with but as something
that has an underlying cause that’s being revealed to me through that
symptom called anxiety. And that underlying cause is the very nature of
your life, of your feelings, of things you’re subjected to, being at
odds with what you think those things are or what you feel those things
should be.</p>
<p>That wrong view, that assumption carries a sense of entitlement and
for that assumption, you’re responsible simply because you don’t
contemplate that underlying nature of experience. In other words, you
don’t dwell enough on the fact that you are not in your control, you
don’t dwell enough on the fact that feelings arise on their own, and
you’re subjected to them. I mean you can act out of them, you can try to
cover them up. But fundamentally, you can never uproot your liability to
feel pleasure, pain, or neutral, you just can’t. So your efforts are
only secondary. The amount of input that you can make is only relative,
it cannot fundamentally upturn that picture. But see, not thinking about
these things and feeling entitled to not think about these things, and
then feeling even further entitlement towards sensuality, chasing sense
pleasures, craving and ambition in life, and trying to get your desires
fulfilled. That’s how you proliferate that very discrepancy between how
things are and how you think they should be. And that’s exactly where
anxiety is.</p>
<p>Removing your expectation of how things should be, and learning how
to accept the way things are is not something that you can do in a
second. You have to keep drilling in that knowledge and practice. You
have to keep training yourself regarding it. Because you’re not just
dealing with one particular problem. You’re reprogramming the entire
attitude towards your existence and that takes time and repetition until
you undo the wrong programming habits, habits of trying to get rid of
the unpleasant feelings as soon as they manifested, habits of trying to
run away from the unpleasant feelings as soon as they’re manifested.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem And Your Choice</strong></p>
<p>Why is an unpleasant feeling, be it anxiety or anything else, why is
it my problem? The anxiety emerges and it feels unpleasant. Why is that
an issue? Why do I immediately think I must get rid of this? You are
still fully aware and fully accountable for your actions, so you don’t
need to choose or decide to do anything on account of it. Why can you
not just be with it? And equally, when pleasant feelings, when enticing
perceptions manifest themselves and you want that pleasure, ask yourself
why do I have to follow this desire? Why can I not just remain
equanimous towards it?</p>
<p>Again, neither sensual desire nor anxiety or unpleasant feeling makes
you act, you are the one who chooses to act upon those things. Yes, they
can exert different pressures and a different pressure means different
amounts of discrepancy. And that depends on where your views are at. The
more you feel entitled to sensuality, the more pressure it’s going to
exhibit on you. And the more entitled you feel to be free from any
unpleasant feeling, the more frightening anxiety will be. But again, it
doesn’t matter how much fear or how much pressure towards sensual
pleasure is manifested. You are the one fundamentally and ultimately,
who decides to act or not act out of it. That’s where your
responsibility is.</p>
<p>You can realize “I don’t have to act out of this. I don’t have to do
anything on account of the arisen anxiety. I could just patiently endure
it. But then the mind will be saying”I must get rid of it!“, but I’ll
withstand that thought as well. I’ll endure those states of mind.” Why?
Because fundamentally, as I said, anxiety is not the issue that
accidentally or mistakenly arose on account of your perfect existence.
Anxiety is an issue that reveals to you that existence in its nature is
imperfect. But the imperfection, it’s not in existence, it’s in your
attitude toward your existence. That’s why anxiety is like an
existential awakening.</p>
<p><strong>Subject To Anxiety</strong></p>
<p>Everybody experiences anxiety, that’s not optional. Everybody is
subjected to it. The difference is that most people can maintain that
thin layer of ignorance, a very frail layer of ignorance upon it so that
they can pretend it’s not there. But it is, it’s always there, it always
has been and will be for as long as the view towards your existence is
at odds with the existence.</p>
<p>Despite that it’s always there, some people are still able to keep
distracting themselves from it. But that doesn’t mean they’re dealing
with it. It actually makes things worse, the more you’re distracting
yourself from it. The more the habit that results in the discrepancy is
being reinforced. So if you spend your whole life running away from
anxiety, it ultimately catches up with you. When death comes, how do you
think it’s going to feel? If public speaking or other such things cause
you anxiety, how do you think you will feel when your life starts to
shut down? How is that going to feel when even little threats to your
existence make you anxious? Imagine when that threat is being realized.
The point is, that is what anxiety shows you, that your life can end at
any given time and you have no say in that yet you live your life as if
you have a say in that. Your health can end at any given time. Yet
you’re fully intoxicated with the fact that you’re not ill now and you
think you’re never going to get ill. Same with youth, strength, and age.
Those things are inevitable and so it is better to tailor your views and
attitudes towards your existence to match that so that there is no more
discrepancy affecting you and making you suffer when it comes.</p>
<p><strong>Freedom From The Discrepancy</strong></p>
<p>The correct practice is to stop trying to not get rid of anxiety,
accept it (not welcome it), and then develop an attitude towards it as a
symptom of an underlying problem, not an issue in itself. And to uproot
the underlying issue that anxiety is a symptom of, you have to start
modifying your own life and your views towards it. If you feel like “Oh,
it’s too much work, look at all these happy people around me.” That’s
your mind playing tricks on you, in a way that’s just lazy thinking, “I
don’t want to do work. Look at all these happy people, I just want to be
like that, I just want this to go away.” That is wishful thinking. You
can carry on wishing that and the more you wish the more you’ll be
subjected to that discrepancy. Or you could take responsibility for it
and realize that this is something worth addressing.</p>
<p>If you truly properly address it and deal with it. That’s it, there
is no discrepancy to be felt. That’s true freedom. There will be no
pressure of sense desires that you can or cannot fulfill, there will be
no fear. There still may be thoughts, “What if this happens, etc”, but
those thoughts are now not causing any discrepancy because you have no
expectations, certainly not assumed fixed expectations such as “Oh, this
must happen or this should happen.” So in that sense, anxiety is still
there. But now you are not there with it anymore. You went beyond it.
The reason it bothers you is that it threatens to overwhelm you. But it
threatens to overwhelm you because you’re too weak regarding it. And
you’re too weak regarding it because you never want to take
responsibility for developing strength towards it. But if you do so, and
you make that effort of being able to allow it to endure, not carelessly
acting out of a habit of trying to get rid of it, not carelessly trying
to distract yourself from it through sensual pursuits, then you see it
coming and going, yet your mind composure will remain unchanged. And
that is true freedom when you are no longer liable to the pressure of
what is felt. Whenever they arise and whatever they might be. So when
there is pleasure, you’re not trying to get more of it automatically,
when there’s pain, you’re not trying to get rid of it automatically. And
when there’s neither pleasure nor pain, you’re not distracted
automatically. The feeling arises and endures, but the mental state, the
composure of your mind remains completely unaffected by that.</p>
<p>This should also answer the question of whether there is some
meditation technique you can do to overcome anxiety. That question, as
it should be clear from this by now, would be coming from the view that
I should be getting rid of this, that I should not feel anxiety in the
first place. And so once you stop having such expectations, you realize
there is no prescription method that you can do, that will then prevent
you from feeling this. There is no prescription method that would
prevent you from existing while you are existing, there is no such
thing. The most important thing you can do regarding the experience of
anxiety is to swallow the hard pill of truth in the sense that you
realize it shows you what existence is about. It’s not something that
can be ignored. If you’re able to accept that as the truth, that’s
already a massive step forward.</p>
<p>To not be affected by anxiety, you have to stop trying to get rid of
it. In the same sense, you can’t get rid of your existence, you can only
grow out of that anxiety whereby when it arises, you are no longer
affected. And the only way you stop being affected by it is if you stop
running away from it, which keeps giving it power.</p>
<p>Anxiety is a symptom that reveals the underlying nature of your
existence, which is not what you assume yourself to be. So if you’re
willing to accept it as such, that’s already half of the problem
gone.</p>
<p>The Buddha asks which feeling is yours, as in which feeling do you
think you are in control of because they keep changing? If you were
truly the controller, you would only feel what you want to feel. And you
can apply the same principle to your thoughts. If you are truly the
controller of your thoughts, you will only think what you want to think,
but in reality thoughts manifest themselves, they present themselves to
you and then you make choices and decisions based upon that. But
fundamentally, they have arisen on their own. That’s why you are
ultimately responsible for your actions, no matter the thoughts arising
on their own, no matter the feelings pressuring you. None of that can
make you act, only your choosing to act makes you act. And that’s what
you’re fully responsible for. There is no excuse for that. You can blame
feelings, the arisen thoughts, or intentions but again you are the one
who chooses that to be the reason for your actions.</p>
<p>That’s why acceptance of what you’re subjected to in terms of
feeling, in terms of thoughts, in terms of the environment is important
so that you can see where the real problem is, which is in the
discrepancy that you maintain, regarding things that you’re subjected
to. If a certain type of environment is causing you overwhelming
anxiety, sure, tone it down a bit, don’t expose yourself to it, but not
for the sake of sheltering yourself from anxiety, just for the sake of
giving yourself a bit of a break, so that you can regain strength to
deal with it. And you don’t deal with it by going straight into what
makes you anxious. No, you deal with it, by changing, upgrading,
reprogramming your views about that thing that causes you anxiety or
about life in general, your expectations, your entitlements, your
assumptions. If you get that to match the actual nature of existence,
the actual nature of your life, then there will be no discrepancy. The
less disparity between the two, the less amount of symptoms will be
showing.</p>
<p>It’s gradual work, gradual effort, gradual acceptance, and gradual
reprogramming. And you can only do so by reflecting upon it, not through
mechanical sets of observances and rules. You can only do so by
accepting the fearful aspect of it bit by bit, but you realize “That’s
the work that needs to be done”. Not “That’s the work that I must get
rid of.” It’s done when it doesn’t affect you. It’s not done when it is
just not there. Because as I said, anxiety mirrors the nature of
existence, which means in a way, that mirror is always there. It’s just
whether you’re going to suffer on account of it or not.</p>
<h2 id="hh--responsibility-can-free-you-from-suffering">64hh-
Responsibility Can Free You From Suffering</h2>
<p>The reason why understanding is hard to develop, is because in order
to do so, one needs to know what must be understood. That might sound
self explanatory, but the point is, understanding takes repetition. One
needs to make the effort of repetitive investigation or drilling into a
certain topic or theme that needs to be clarified, i.e. the theme or
aspect of experience that one wants to develop clarity in regard to. In
order to do that, you need to know what to look for, you need to know
how to approach it and what to understand. Getting information about it
is absolutely necessary, but information in itself, as vast as it can
be, is not ‘understanding’. Which is something that many people would
confuse; knowing a lot about something does not mean you understand it,
especially when it comes down to the Nature of things, feelings,
intentions, or the Nature of experience as a whole.</p>
<p>When it comes to practising the Dhamma, many people mystify it, as
in, go after an experience of some kind of new amazing feeling which
they can interpret as understanding/enlightenment, a kind of ‘intuitive
wisdom’. However, if you cannot explain an experience or make it
intelligible to yourself or to somebody else, you should not think you
understood it. Now, of course you’re free to use your own words, so to
speak, you don’t have to use already given templates of descriptions and
so on. But the point is, you will still be able to convey the meaning if
you understood that experience in its <em>nature</em>, and that’s the
crucial factor here, the meaning of the experience, the meaning of
whatever might have happened to you that you think was somehow worthy in
your practice, in your meditation or in any other area of life for that
matter. And that’s when you realise that most of the time, even things
that you think you understand, upon which you act and choose to live
your life, you haven’t actually understood the meaning behind, you just
act, you just go along with it, i.e. it made some vague sense to you, or
as the Buddha said, you will be doing these things or holding those
views, simply because it pleases you, simply because it “feels” good,
and that’s the sole criteria for most people. They find an idea pleasing
and that’s why they defend their view and their actions based on their
chosen views. Either way, there is no understanding of those things.
That’s the important difference that we are trying to highlight here.
Basically it’s not about the experience that you might have, it’s about
understanding it. And if understanding is the focus, that’s when you
realise the content of the experience doesn’t matter as much, as long as
it’s wholesome, as long as it’s based on restraint and virtue, then you
realise it’s the understanding of any experience which results in
freedom from suffering, that matters.</p>
<p>The reason why this practice, given by the Buddha, the practice of
<em>understanding</em> is harder than just sitting and trying to develop
calmness or pleasant feeling through some practice of concentration, is
because it will result initially, in causing doubt and restlessness in
your mind. But that’s how you know that you are doing it properly. By
working through these things, you learn to be imperturbable in the face
of the thinking mind, not the other way round. You’re afraid of the
thinking mind because it disturbs you, and then you try to stop the
thinking, you try to concentrate on a little point so you don’t have to
think about anything else. However, you need to develop strength in the
face of that which wants to move you, in order to be immovable, not
control the content that disturbs you. So it’s important to then
obviously read the Suttas and get the idea as to what needs to be
understood. But very often, it comes down to that tedious, ambiguous,
heavy drilling of your thought.</p>
<p>Sit down in a quiet, non-crowded environment and ask yourself,
“Intention, intention, what is intention? Do I know what intention is
for me, for myself, in my own experience? When I say intention, what do
I refer to? Is it understood? What is it? Whatever it is, do I try to
understand it, or do I just sort of float on the surface of the meaning
of intention? Is the meaning vague? How would I describe my
intention?”</p>
<p>Try writing down what your intention is and then afterwards, read
that back to yourself and see if it makes any sense. If it does, then
push the questions further. So, in this case, you ask, “So what is
intent? What is my intention? Like now, I have the intention to be
seated here and contemplate the nature of intention? What is the
intention that’s making me do this? What is it? Is it a fleeting
thought? Well, it isn’t, because I’m still seated, trying to contemplate
these things. Which means that that thought is present throughout these
more particular actions that I’m doing, that I’m trying to contemplate.
I remain seated, I still haven’t switched on my phone, I still haven’t
opened my door to the world. So, all these other things I do are on the
basis of a simultaneously present more general intention, which is to
ponder on the nature of intention, or the nature of feeling or the
nature of five aggregates ….”. So how else would you then describe that
presently enduring intention? Is it a thought? Is it some sort of
perception? It is, because if it weren’t, you wouldn’t be able to talk
about it, you wouldn’t be able to designate it even for yourself, let
alone for others. So, it’s a peripheral thought, which in this case, I
have the intention to sit down and contemplate.</p>
<p>You don’t have to keep it in front of your mind, as in, while you’re
sitting and contemplating. You don’t have to keep saying to yourself, “I
want to sit, I want to sit, I want to contemplate, that’s my intention.”
No, because these actions already carry that intention. That’s how
intentions work. That’s why I keep saying the most important thing for
somebody who wants to start the practice or somebody who’s already
developing it, is to develop full transparency in regard to present
enduring motivations behind the smallest of actions. That’s how you get
to discern the fundamental aspect of wholesome or unwholesome, good or
bad, healthy or unhealthy, and especially to discern where your actions
are rooted. Because if you’re not aware of this peripheral thought of
your intention that directs all of your particular actions, while it
endures, you’re not aware of where that action or those actions are
rooted.</p>
<p>Intention is wholesome or unwholesome or neutral, but for practical
sake, just look for wholesome and unwholesome, if it’s unwholesome avoid
it, if it’s wholesome, don’t try to deny it or fear it, just let it be,
let it endure. Either way, they arise on their own, but your
responsibility is not to try to prevent them from arising, your
responsibility is to prevent yourself from acting out of it. So as I
said, even if you’re a beginner, sit down, quietly, in a semi-protected
environment, undistracted, and question the things you’re doing and
things you want to do. Bring them forward to your mind, and then think
about why you want to act, “Oh, it’s because of this and that. Well, why
is this and that a reason for me doing these things? Why did I choose
that to be the reason?”.</p>
<p>It’s always on you, intention is always your responsibility. That’s
why the Buddha said that every action is an intention. You can’t commit
an action without having it rooted in an intention. And that’s what
“beings are owners of their actions” means. Only you, nobody else, which
means you are fundamentally always responsible for what you choose to
do. That’s not negotiable or optional.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Beings are owners of their actions, heirs of their actions, born of
their actions, related through their actions, and have their actions as
their arbitrator. Action is what differentiates beings in terms of
baseness &amp; excellence.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>– <a href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN135.html">MN

</blockquote>
<p>Ask yourself, “What is the intention? When I say intention,
intention? What am I referring to in this experience as a whole?”. We
have established it’s a sort of ambiguous peripheral thought, an idea or
context of all these little things that you are doing. You don’t have to
keep staring at little things that you’re doing in order to discern
intention. Why? Because the intention always comes first structurally,
simultaneously the intentions and actions are present. But intention is
deeper, so to speak, it’s not that you have the intention and then the
actions. No, you have intentions and you have your environment in regard
to which you have intentions. But that’s when you recognise that these
intentions determine the course of my action, and for that I’m
responsible for saying yes or no to them.</p>
<p>So, we established that an intention in the most fundamental, most
basic, the most straightforward description, is a thought, a right
thought or a bad thought. You have a thought that gives the context to
your present actions. But if you’re unaware of that thought, it means
you are unaware of the nature of it, whether the nature is wholesome or
unwholesome. And if that is the case, that means you will not know
whether your actions are rooted in good or bad. Through avoiding
responsibility for your intentions, you end up avoiding responsibility
for your actions down the line. That’s why the five or eight precepts,
i.e. virtue, always has to come first.</p>
<p>You have to start narrowing down your ‘avoidance of responsibility’.
Someone who doesn’t keep the precepts, he avoids responsibility left and
right and there is no base for Dhamma whatsoever. If you start keeping
the precepts, that’s where you create a basis for progress in Dhamma.
You might avoid responsibility here and there, and until you invest
enough work into that, and rectify that, at least you will not avoid
responsibility past this point, past the five precepts or eight, and so
on. You start rounding up that avoidance of responsibility for your
actions, and that can then bring further clarity to the fact that your
responsibility goes even beyond that, that you are responsible for
welcoming the thought of greed, the thought of aversion, ill will,
cruelty, and the thought of distraction. That’s why the Buddha would
say, the noble disciple, the one with the right view, who has developed
clarity in regard to the nature of his intentions, all he has to do is
not tolerate and not delight and not welcome the unwholesome thoughts.
All he has to do is not be ignorant and distract himself from wholesome
thoughts.</p>
<p>So when unwholesome/unhealthy intentions arise, he’s aware of it, he
understands it, and all he needs to do is abstain from doing anything on
account of it. He knows, “I will not welcome this and I will not
entertain this thought to stay for even a second longer.”. If that
attitude is present, it will be impossible for him to act out of it. The
only way you can act out of unwholesome intentions, is if you ignore
that they are unwholesome because as soon as you’re aware of their
unwholesomeness, you cannot act, it’s mutually exclusive. You must
ignore the unwholesome in order to act out of it. And that’s exactly why
ignorance is the most blameworthy, it’s a fundamental prerequisite for
anything unwholesome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Blessed One said this: Bhikkhus, before my awakening, while I
was still only seeking awakening, it occurred to me: ’Suppose that I
divide my thoughts into two classes. Then I set on one side thoughts of
sensual desire, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of cruelty, and I set
on the other side thoughts of renunciation, thoughts of non-ill will,
and thoughts of non-cruelty.</p>
<p>“As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, a thought of
sensual desire (<em>and a thought of either ill-will or cruelty</em>)
arose in me. I understood thus: ‘This thought of sensual desire has
arisen in me. This leads to my own affliction, to others’ affliction,
and to the affliction of both; it obstructs wisdom, causes difficulties,
and leads away from Nibbāna.’ - When I considered: ‘This leads to my own
affliction,’ it subsided in me; when I considered: ‘This leads to
others’ affliction,’ it subsided in me; when I considered: ‘This leads
to the affliction of both,’ it subsided in me; when I considered: ‘This
obstructs wisdom, causes difficulties, and leads away from Nibbāna,’ it
subsided in me. Whenever a thought of sensual desire arose in me, I
abandoned it, removed it, and did away with it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, whatever a bhikkhu frequently thinks and ponders upon,
that will become the inclination of his mind. If he frequently thinks
and ponders upon thoughts of sensual desire, he has abandoned the
thought of renunciation to cultivate the thought of sensual desire, and
then his mind inclines to thoughts of sensual desire. If he frequently
thinks and ponders upon thoughts of ill will…upon thoughts of cruelty,
he has abandoned the thought of non-cruelty to cultivate the thought of
cruelty, and then his mind inclines to thoughts of cruelty.</p>
<p>“Just as in the last month of the rainy season, in the autumn, when
the crops thicken, a cowherd would guard his cows by constantly tapping
and poking them on this side and that with a stick to check and curb
them. Why is that? Because he sees that he could be flogged, imprisoned,
fined, or blamed if he let them stray into the crops. So too I
understood, in unwholesome states there is danger, degradation, and
defilement, and in wholesome states the blessing of renunciation, the
aspect of cleansing.</p>
<p>“As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, a thought of
renunciation arose in me. I understood thus: ‘This thought of
renunciation has arisen in me. This does not lead to my own affliction,
or to others’ affliction, or to the affliction of both; it aids wisdom,
does not cause difficulties, and leads to Nibbāna. If I think and ponder
upon this thought even for a night, even for a day, even for a night and
day, I see nothing to fear from it. But with excessive thinking and
pondering I might tire my body, and when the body is tired, the mind
becomes strained, and when the mind is strained, it is far from
composure.’ So I steadied, stilled, unified and composed my mind
internally. Why is that? So that my mind should not be strained…”</p>

<p><em>Avijja</em>-Ignorance it’s not some sort of metaphysical and
mysterious cloud of unknowing that deludes you, it’s this very act of
ignoring your responsibility, avoiding transparency, avoiding the
recognition of your choice in regards to the present intention. That’s
ignorance and that’s how you carry it, you perpetuate it through your
own actions. Ignorant actions perpetuate ignorance because of which
actions are ignorant. It’s a vicious circle, but you can break through
it if you start accepting that responsibility, if you start looking at
the motivation behind your action, and develop clarity in regard to its
nature.</p>
<p>As I said, ask yourself, “What is the nature of intention? When I say
intention what do I refer to? Do I refer to a specific or general
thought, to a mood, a feeling, what is it?” The main problem is not
necessarily not being able to give an answer right away. The main
problem is not even attempting to think about it in the first place,
which is what most people do because initially it’s so ambiguous. It’s
going to take a lot of effort because we are used to just being focused
on the content/positive aspect as opposed to the negative, i.e. the
background context. So now you have to be discerning the <em>nature</em>
in regard to the present content. That’s why this kind of thinking
requires constant drilling/repetition, and the prerequisites of virtue
and sense restraint in order for understanding to take root. Otherwise,
it just won’t happen, you will just be floating from one content to
another.</p>
<p>You can pick up any theme, like the aggregate of feeling, for
example, and ask yourself: “What do I feel right now? What is the nature
of the feeling? How would I describe it? Is it an idea? If I say,”Oh, I
feel light, heavy, etc,” are those feelings or are those perceptions of
lightness and so on? Feelings, as the suttas say, are pleasant,
unpleasant, or neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant. So all these perceptions
I’m talking about, I feel light, I feel heavy, I feel this, I feel like
that, etc. Where are they rooted, presently? Is it pleasant, unpleasant
or neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant?…” .That’s how you start clarifying
the feeling. You realise that most often, things we think feelings are,
are actually perceptions, thoughts and concepts. And you will be talking
about those things as your feelings, for as long as you don’t make the
effort to think about what the actual feeling is.</p>
<p>You can see that the practice of Right understanding, the practice of
developing the Right view, is not about building some intricate system
of special meditation techniques that will then culminate in release of
all bad energy and involve a mystical experience, through practice and
effort. It’s about undoing the state of a <em>puthujjana</em>, the state
of an ignorant ordinary person who is a prey to suffering. That state is
the starting point for everyone. It’s not about building something new
on top of the state of an ignorant <em>puthujjana</em>, it’s about
removing everything that makes you a <em>puthujjana</em>. That’s how you
become a <em>sotapanna</em> free from suffering.</p>
<p>Lack of understanding, replaced with understanding, means that all
the wrong views are gone. Lack of understanding in regard to what? In
regards to the nature of your experience, the five aggregates, in
regards to the suffering and freedom from it, in regard to any topic
from the suttas. Fully understand those themes that matter and you would
have then undone your ignorance that was maintaining your ignorant state
of a <em>puthujjana</em>.</p>
<p>In terms of meditation, you don’t have to start with some complex
topics. Just pick up things/themes that you think you know and then
really investigate them. By that, I mean, contemplate them rightly, not
just think about the information you have about it. Pick up things you
know, and see whether you really know them. Don’t pull any punches,
don’t be afraid of what you might discover. Dedicate yourself to
clarifying the meaning, which means make yourself open to the
possibility of doubt, which can be very unpleasant. And the way you’re
going to deal with that doubt will be self-evident if you have your
virtue established beforehand. If you’ve been living virtuously and you
recognise the necessity of that virtue, that will take care of the
unpleasantness of doubt and restlessness and so on. But you have to go
through with it. The longer a person who wants to practice Dhamma,
avoids this, the harder it’s going to be to do it later.</p>
<p>Ask yourself about the things you think you understood. Whatever it
is, whatever sutta you read and you think you made sense of, question it
or even ask yourself what do you want to get out of the practice? Do you
want peace? How would you define that peace? Do you have clarity in
regard to what peace means? What does it mean? Peaceful means
non-disturbed. Okay, so take it a step further. What is the disturbance
then? How are you disturbed? Are you disturbed when you experience
things you don’t want to experience? Are you disturbed when you don’t
experience things you want to experience? What’s in common to any form
of disturbance? What’s in common is, it is suffering, it’s unpleasant.
If disturbance is not unpleasant, it wouldn’t be a disturbance. So, you
want peace, which is freedom from disturbance, which means peace is
freedom from unpleasant feeling, freedom from suffering. Peace equals
absence of suffering altogether.</p>
<p>Now, of course, that makes sense. But by going through these motions
of repetitive self-reflexive contemplating, you’re actually clarifying
things layer by layer and next time when something bothers you, when you
suffer on account of it, you will realise, “Well, I’m not automatically
disturbed by things that bother me, I’m only disturbed when I start
suffering on account of things that bother me, so peace is not, not
having anything come my way. Peace is about not being disturbed, not
suffering on account of whatever comes my way.” Ultimately, sickness,
ageing and death will come your way, that’s not negotiable. So these
little layers that you will be undoing through reflection. That’s all
that matters. That’s how you practice gradually, bit by bit.</p>
<p>When the Buddha says that the root of suffering is your own craving,
not the conditions in regard to which you crave, then you can realise
that you’re affected by disturbance of any kind because you disturb
yourself, nobody or nothing else does that to you. That can sound quite
blunt in a way, but at the same time, it’s the best possible news you
can receive because if suffering were truly rooted in circumstances or
other people’s actions, you can’t control that, you can’t even access
that and therefore you wouldn’t be able to free yourself from it. But it
isn’t rooted in external circumstances, and that’s the good news.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s teaching should be considered as a very strict form of
optimism. It’s recognising the problem and knowing exactly what to do
about it. Its recognising that the problem of you being disturbed by
things which make you non-peaceful, lies in you craving for the present
pleasant feeling, to stay longer or simply to stay, craving for the
present unpleasant feeling to go away, as soon as possible, and craving
for the neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling to be ignored or not to
be experienced. Practically, those are the three attitudes that
perpetuate your liability to suffering.</p>
<p>In order to stop craving in regard to these feelings, you have to
learn how to discern these feelings for what they are. Which brings us
to the questions we brought up earlier,“Feeling, feeling, what is
feeling? When I say feeling, what am I referring to? What is that
phenomenon? What is that thing, present in my experience as a whole,
that I designate by saying feeling?”. How would you describe your
pleasant feeling? Don’t jump to conclusions, just pause, ask yourself
the question, let the question endure for as long as it will and if your
mind starts wandering away, ask the question again and then try to think
about it a little bit more, but don’t rush into an answer. Why? Because
you don’t want to be producing the answer, you want to be discerning it.
Why? Because that present feeling is present. You don’t need to answer
it in order for that feeling to be there. The fact that you were able to
designate it means it’s there. It’s your preconceived notions about the
feeling, which obscures you understanding its nature. That’s what <a
href="https://suttacentral.net/mn1">Mūlapariyāyasutta</a> is all about,
it describes all the conceivings that you do on account of the arisen
experience, not before the arisen experience. It’s about clearing out
your “conceivings” and discerning things in their <em>nature</em>. If
you can discern the nature of the presently enduring feeling, then you
will be unable to crave it.</p>

Comprehending The Mindfulness Of Breathing And Death</h2>
<p>Contemplation</p>
<h4 id="i.-mindfulness-of-breathing">I. Mindfulness of Breathing</h4>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> I wanted to ask about mindfulness of
breathing, and how that should be done. You can read the sutta over and
over again and try to follow some sort of method, step-by-step. “You
breathe in, then you breathe out. I’ll breathe in, thinking about my
body.”</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> “I attend to this, I attend to that.
I do this, I do that.”</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> And you can actually run through all
those steps forward, backward, however you want…</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> And still not do the mindfulness of
breathing.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> So what is best to do?</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Well, as the name itself says, it’s
mindfulness—mindfulness of breathing. In order to do mindfulness of
breathing, you need to know what mindfulness is.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> So, what is mindfulness?</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Mindfulness, if done rightly, is
effortless. Mindfulness is not something you can do. Mindfulness is
something you discern on account of the presently enduring
things―experience as a whole, that includes feelings, body, etc. There
are many different ways you can establish mindfulness, but the principle
of mindfulness is the same. It’s to be discerned.</p>
<p>So what is it that you discern in order to become mindful? Well, for
example, you discern your presently enduring situation. So you have an
option: you can be absorbed with the presently enduring
situation—something can take 100% of your attention, i.e. you’re dealing
with this problem or looking at this or doing that; but including
self-awareness into whatever you’re doing, that’s already a step closer
to the proper mindfulness. And that’s not something you can do, it’s
more like an attitude you can have in regard to things you do. That’s
why, fundamentally, a meditation “method” is inherently wrong from the
point of view of mindfulness—because you can’t be doing the mindfulness.
Yet, as the Buddha said, meditation is nothing other than the
unshakeable, imperturbable establishment of mindfulness. So if you’re
not doing mindfulness from the start, how can you magically establish it
through something you do, some methods or repetitions? It’s a
recognition of your situation while at the same time, simultaneously
with that recognition, you are in the situation. In other words, you can
be sitting on a chair now, and with a corner of your eye, with the back
of your mind, you’re aware of that. That doesn’t mean you need to stand
up or lay down or start walking in order to know that you were seated on
the chair. That’s why the bodily postures or just awareness of the body
is so fundamental. So mindfulness done properly means, basically,
awareness of your situation, whether it’s established upon the body or
feelings or the state of minds (moods), it’s established in that
background, so you’re not attending it. I don’t have to keep sitting
here thinking: “I’m seated… I’m seated… I’m seated”. I don’t need to
keep repeating that to myself. Why? Because I already know that I’m
seated, even if I don’t think about it. So if you were to ask me “what’s
your body posture?”, I’ll immediately say “I’m seated”. And that’s what
you want to tap into, so to speak. The proper development of mindfulness
is tapping into what you already know. It’s not doing what you think you
must be doing. “I’m seated… I’m seated… I’m feeling the chair… I’m
feeling the chair… My legs are folded… I’m feeling the floor”. That’s
all a result of you already knowing that you’re seated, that’s not your
sitting. In other words, whether you’re attending to your feet, your
back or whatever else is going on while you’re seated, that’s secondary
to the fact that you’re already seated, and you already know that you’re
seated. So instead of giving in to that thinking of “I’m doing this… I’m
doing this”—almost like exercising your sense of control over your
meditation technique—you want to recognize that you already know what
you’re doing, and then just try not to forget that little bit, that one
percent, that one grain. Don’t forget what you already know, which means
you don’t need the active effort of reminding yourself that you’re
seated. All you need to do is just keep a corner of your eye on the fact
that you already know that you’re seated. And how do you know? Because
you’re seated. So that knowledge doesn’t come from you, it’s just a
recognition of how things are. That’s why through that mindfulness you
learn how to discern how things are. That’s why that type of mindfulness
will result in discerning impermanence, suffering, lack of control… all
of that. But it won’t result in that if you do it on your own terms,
which is thinking: “This is what I’m doing, this is my meditation… I’m
touching… feeling… sitting”. That’s basically you doing what you think
you should be doing, but the fact is that a puthujjana already starts
with a wrong view, which means whatever he thinks he should be doing, he
will be doing it with a wrong view. That’s why you can’t have too much
mindfulness either—because it’s not doing. It’s the recognition of what
you already know, and that knowledge is not on you.</p>
<p>The same applies in regard to body postures or in regard to the
presently enduring feeling. Again, that’s something you already know, so
if I ask you how do you feel, you might think about how you feel in this
particular regard, but if I ask you how do you feel overall—Is it OK?
How is your mood, generally?—you’ll immediately know whether it’s “plus”
or “minus”, so to speak. Whether it’s OK or whether it isn’t OK, whether
it’s neither. So it’s tapping into what you already know, and you
already know it because it’s present on its own terms. Feeling is there
enduring, whichever it is. And it’s because of you not keeping a corner
of your eye on what you already know that you get distracted, pulled by
sensuality, ill-will, reacting, causing more trouble for yourself, all
these things.</p>
<p>That’s why people are afraid to be alone as well, because they’re
dependent on something to take away their attention, have something to
attend to, including their meditation technique, and they don’t stay
with what they already know because it’s frightening. Initially, at
least. If you were to just not do anything, including your meditation
technique, the pressure is going to start building up. It is about
solitude, not doing anything. Doing is required for the maintenance of
your being. That’s why many people depend on activities of all sorts.
Yes, you can have a good activity, bad activity, less bad activity, but
overall, you depend on the activity. But mindfulness is not an activity!
That’s why you cannot have too much of it, and that’s why you can
actually develop wisdom on account of it if you start discerning it
rightly. And that’s why you need to know what mindfulness is in order to
do it rightly, not just saying: “OK, I’m mindful now”. You can’t start
perfectly, you can’t start rightly from the beginning, but you can
certainly arrive at it if you don’t take for granted what you think
mindfulness is as mindfulness. You realize: if I were to know what
mindfulness is, I would have at least the Right View. I would be at
least a sotāpanna. So if I’m not a sotāpanna, that means I don’t quite
know what mindfulness is, so whatever I think mindfulness is, I must
upgrade. Through that, I must discern it further. Either way, it’s a
win-win. If you already know what mindfulness is, great. Doing more of
it cannot bring any harm. If you don’t know what mindfulness is, and
then you end up doing more, and you understand what mindfulness is, you
win again. So you’ve nothing to lose by regarding yourself as not
knowing quite what mindfulness is, or by investigating further.</p>
<p>The only thing you have to lose is your vanity and conceit that made
you believe you already understood it, and that it’s already helpful,
already works and so on. Because if it does, you wouldn’t have a problem
upgrading it or pushing it further. Because if it truly works, it will
stand that test—nothing will happen to it. But the fact that some people
might be defending their meditation technique and get very touchy over
it or over their practice of mindfulness means there’s passion invested
in it—there’s conceit and vanity invested in it. And that’s not
mindfulness, then.</p>
<p>Now that we clarified what mindfulness is, we come to mindfulness of
breathing. You can do the breathing, but you can’t do the “mindfulness”
in “mindfulness of breathing”. In other words, saying mindfulness of
breathing means knowledge of breathing, knowledge of the act of
breathing. And that’s why the Buddha says in that sutta, “Knowingly he
breaths in, knowingly he breaths out”, that’s what his mindfulness is.
It’s on that level of that discernment of what’s already there. You want
to be mindful of an activity, of something you do. What is the neutral
activity that your body does whether you want it or not? It’s breathing
in, breathing out. So you want to be aware of the background of your act
of breathing in and breathing out. In other words, you don’t want to be
attending to your breath directly—you want to make it become a
background of whatever your mind is thinking. So you’re mindful of
breathing. Or you can even bring it to the foreground if you want, but
again, not in a sense of thinking “I’m perceiving my breath…” or keep
repeating “Nostrils… Nostrils…”. Not like that. It still has to be on
the level of that knowledge, because if I ask you now “Are you
breathing?”, you will know that you are. You don’t have to stop
breathing to give me the answer, you can’t even doubt whether you’re
breathing or not. You already know that you’re breathing. That’s what
you want to learn through the mindfulness of breathing—recognition of
what you already know.</p>
<p>And that’s not something you always have to maintain, or even can
maintain 100% in front of you, thinking “I’m breathing… I’m breathing…”.
Let it drift away without losing sight of it. So, here you are, sitting,
semi-comfortably (not too comfortably because you’ll fall asleep), wide
awake, eyes open, and you’re breathing. And now know that you know that
you’re breathing. That’s it. There is no “What do I do next?”. Nothing.
So there is the in-breath, there is the out-breath… there is the
in-breath… Either way, they all stand within that knowledge of “I am
breathing”.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a particular in-breath or a particular out-breath, the
knowledge of breathing remains the same. That’s why, then, the Buddha
would say “He would breathe in like this, or like this… Short breath or
long breath…” Point being, the knowledge of that breathing still stays
the same—mindfulness gets established, regardless of the type of breath
or how different it is.</p>
<p>And it’s the same principle with mindfulness of the body. When the
Buddha would say “he’s mindful of the body like this (standing, sitting,
laying down, etc.), or he’s mindful to the extent necessary for final
knowledge that ‘body is there’”. As in the ultimate background of any of
your activities is the background of your body being present there as a
basis on account of which you can do all these activities and
engagements—feel feelings, perceive perceptions and so on. So if your
mind never forgets that 0.01% of what it already knows of that body
being a necessary basis for it, your mind cannot give rise to avijjā,
whether you recognize it at that time or not doesn’t matter—you’re doing
it rightly. If you’re doing it rightly, the time will come when you’ve
done it rightly sufficiently that you recognize what you’ve been doing
rightly.</p>
<p>That’s also another reason why nobody can accidentally stumble upon
the Right View. It takes repetition of something you took either through
intellectual discernment or on faith, but you’ve been doing it rightly,
and when you’ve been doing it rightly sufficiently, then you recognize
right as right, which is the basic definition of sotāpanna. “He knows
kusala as kusala and akusala as akusala”. But he wouldn’t have arrived
at it if he hadn’t been doing it rightly on account of the utterance of
another and his own faith in it and rightly understanding it on that
intellectual level.</p>
<p>Mindfulness of breathing is the same principle of mindfulness.
Breathing is there. Whether it’s a short breath, long breath, quick
breath, slow breath…—breathing is there. And that’s what you know. In a
way, breathing is doing, but knowledge of breathing is not doing. Why
would the Buddha then say doing? Because sometimes you want to do
something. You want to replace coarse doing with refined doing. You want
to replace unwholesome doing with wholesome doing, and breathing, being
the most neutral type of doing, is the wholesome doing you can do,
because it’s just neutral. Doesn’t harm anyone, doesn’t harm you,
doesn’t harm others. You can develop mindfulness, you can develop
knowledge of that neutral type of doing. And it’s also repetitive, which
means it doesn’t require your attention as when you’re solving a task or
doing some menial work or whatever. It’s just breathing—it happens
whether you think about it or not. So you want to discern it on the
level of doing, but discern it, not do it yourself. And how do you do
that? Start breathing, secluded, alone. And ask yourself “Am I breathing
right now? Yes.” That’s already an increment in the right direction of
that knowledge—you already know you’re breathing. Are you still
breathing? Yes. So you still know you’re breathing—same breathing, same
knowledge. So you have the same thing enduring now. Now you don’t even
have to ask yourself whether you’re breathing—you just remind yourself
of what you already know. Yes, you are still breathing. So you can stop
saying “still”, you can just stay “Yes, I’m breathing”. You don’t even
have to say it, you can’t think it. When you become familiar with that,
as in knowing that right now, you’re still breathing, you can then look
within that.</p>
<p>For example, noticing that the breath is quite slow right now, and
you already know that. You’re not doing it, you’re discerning what’s
being done. Well, you can do it, but you realize that you doing it is
secondary to the discernment of what’s being done, and that’s
incidentally how you also overcome the nature of action, how you disown
it, but let’s not complicate things here. Ask yourself: are you still
breathing? You are. All this time you had the same mindfulness of the
same breathing. Particularly the breath kept going in, going out, but
overall, breathing is there. Body sits, body stands up, body goes, body
lays down—body is there. That’s why ānāpānasāti results in the four
foundations of mindfulness being brought to fulfillment, as the Buddha
said. It doesn’t result in mystical experiences of meditative lights and
whatnot. It results in clarity of mindfulness. Clarity of mindfulness
results in the Four Right Strivings, the Four Right strivings in the
Enlightenment Factors, and that’s it. No other work for you to be done.
Why? Because you brought that knowledge of the nature of things to
fulfillment.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> To the fore.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Well, yes. So bringing mindfulness
of breathing to the fore means thinking: “OK, am I breathing now? Yes”.
Then you ask yourself: “Am I still aware that I am breathing now? Yes.
How am I breathing now? Medium-pace.” You can designate it if you want,
there is no right answer to it. There’s only right direction or wrong
direction, as in there is only knowledge of it or non-knowledge of it.
Ask yourself: “By the way, how am I feeling while I’m breathing right
now? Overall, fundamentally pleasant. But am I still breathing? Yes.” So
your mindfulness is still “concerned” or “anchored”, for the lack of a
better word, in the act of breathing. Then you think: “What are the
thoughts that keep popping up in my mind while I’m breathing?” With the
same breathing, same mindfulness, same knowledge of the same breathing.
Maybe you’re thinking about how long you can do this, what you do next
and so on. Ask yourself, are those thoughts pleasant or unpleasant? All
of this while you’re breathing. You didn’t stop breathing while you were
thinking all of this. You haven’t lost sight of the breath as the basis
of all these things. Then you recognize, for example, “I’m feeling
doubtful…” Or whatever you discover, as I said, there is no right
answer, there is only losing the sight of your breathing, or not losing
it. Then you might stop thinking about it, and ask yourself: “What’s the
state of my mind while I’m breathing? Am I depressed, am I elated, am I
happy, am I sad? What is my mood?” While you’re breathing in and
breathing out—all this time. And there you go. You don’t need to do
anything else when it comes to mindfulness of breathing. Just keep doing
that, because you’ll be developing mindfulness of the body, mindfulness
of feelings, mindfulness of mind and mindfulness of thoughts, which are
the Satipaṭṭhāna. Which is why the Ānāpānasati Sutta (MN 118) says
that—fulfillment of ānāpānasati brings the fulfillment of satipaṭṭhāna.
Nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> It also says that you get rid of
distracting thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Exactly, because they’re all rooted
in losing the sight of that peripheral—in losing mindfulness, basically.
Not being anchored in the recognition of what’s peripherally
enduring.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> The background.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Exactly, that’s lust, aversion… That
is a necessary basis for lust, aversion, and distraction to arise—losing
sight of what you already know, i.e. that certain feelings, body,
intentions, perceptions, etc. are enduring there on their own in that
background. And you actively choose to ignore them. That’s why
everybody’s fully responsible for their greed, aversion, and delusion.
It’s not accidental, it’s maintained through your consciously-made
decisions. Not that you fully understand the decisions you’re making,
but you are making them. You choose to go down sensuality, you choose to
go down the ill-will—you choose to not say no to those things, including
distraction. That’s why all someone who understands that needs to do is
stop delighting in it. He doesn’t stop thinking sensual thoughts or bad
thoughts, but he stops delighting in them. That’s how you stop thinking
them. Not by preventing them from arising, but by not fueling them
further. If you’re just mindful: “I’m seated… I’m seated…”, you’re not
doing anything. So you could fall asleep or you could get easily
distracted. But breathing is something that’s done, which means it’s
more active. Yet, at the same time, the principle of mindfulness is not
compromised because it doesn’t really take away your attention. On the
basis of knowing that breathing is there, you can discern what kind of
breathing is there. On the basis of knowing that breathing is there, you
can discern what feeling is there. On the basis of knowing that
breathing is there, you can discern what mood is there. On the basis of
knowing that breathing is there, you can discern what exactly your mind
is thinking right now—particular thoughts of this or that. So on the
basis of doing things, you’re discerning what’s present. You develop
that, that means there will be less and less chances of being distracted
even when you’re not practicing actively in meditation.</p>
<p>Whether you’re sweeping leaves, walking, sitting, extending your
limbs, that mindfulness pertains to it. Because, again, you don’t
necessarily have to think “I’m breathing… I’m breathing…”, because you
already know you’re breathing. So you just learn, basically, how to tap
into that point of view of that breathing being already there—of that
body being already there—which automatically is something that is not
your point of view, because you are not doing it.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> You could say it comes before your
point of view…?</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Well, it comes before your
appropriation of the point of view through action. As in when you think:
“I’m looking at this, I’m doing this, that’s my point of view”. But the
only reason you’re able to do that is because these things are there on
their own enduring already—body is there, feelings are there,
perceptions are there, intentions are there, pretty much. So, again,
there are no steps to mindfulness of breathing—there is mindfulness of
breathing and different aspects of it, of the same principle of
mindfulness of breathing. I’m breathing, I’m still breathing. Still the
same mindfulness, all this time since we’ve been talking about it. Lots
of things have changed on a particular level—new thoughts, new moods,
new feelings—yet that breathing is still the same. Mindfulness,
knowledge of that same breathing is still there.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> And that breathing is a nutriment, you
could say.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> It’s a basis, it’s a reference
point, an anchor—a background, basically, of everything else more
particular.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> And one can see that eventually, at
least…</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Well, there is no “endgame”. There
is not an “and then this happens”. If you just keep doing mindfulness of
breathing, what’s going to happen is everything inferior to it,
everything more particular to it is going to be purified of greed,
aversion, and delusion. It’s going to be purified of the basis of
non-mindfulness. Why? Because you’re developing the basis of
mindfulness. Through doing it, you’re removing the nutriment for all the
unwholesome things you’ve been doing and deciding to do. Mindfulness of
breathing is on the level of mindfulness of death, or any other
mindfulness. That’s why the Buddha taught it as a replacement to
Maranānussati. He said, “Instead of that, because some monks couldn’t
quite handle it, practice mindfulness of breathing”. But it’s the same
goal. As in stick with the most fundamental discernment of things not
being in your control, being already there enduring despite whether you
want them or not, whether you do them or not. It is a death of your
sense of self. Death of your activity, of the notion that you are the
one who maintains things, that you’re the one who’s in control. That
sense just gets completely pushed out, fades away.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> So, when to do mindfulness of death?
How is that done? Where is the death that you’re mindful of?</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Again, start with mindfulness of the
body. You start seeing the body as a necessary, organic, made out of
organs, thing in the world because of you which you experience the world
and everything in it. All your happiness, sadness, choices and decisions
are inconceivable if the body wasn’t there, simultaneously present and
living. Do you have any say in that? That body that you find there—that
you were given, of a certain height, certain complexion, whatever—can
you make it not age? Can you prevent it from getting sick? Can you
ultimately command to it to never die? So those are the first three
basic things that people don’t dwell on. That’s why the Buddha said that
people are intoxicated with life, intoxicated with youth, intoxicated
with health. You choose to become intoxicated by refusing to look at the
obvious characteristics of it because they’re unpleasant, they fill you
with anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> So that’s that inevitable possibility
of death.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Yes. So once you start recognizing
that the presence of the body is just a necessary nutriment for your
experience as a whole, of any kind, you stop being concerned with the
particulars of that experience, such as: “This bothers me… this makes me
happy…” You realize that it’s fundamental nature is undermined by the
presence of the living body. And when that changes, none of it can
remain standing a second longer—none of your feelings or things can
stay. So how can they be yours? And that’s basically beginning to
acknowledge death—the destruction that is impending upon the body, upon
the senses. Decay, fading away, disintegration. You think about that,
you’re going to be less and less intoxicated with things that come
through it—with your sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, thoughts.
Why? Because you recognize that whatever they are, they cannot step
outside of the confinement of the necessary basis of this living body.
You think: “Am I breathing? Yes. What position is the body in? It’s
seated.” That seated body while you’re breathing in and out right now,
what are its characteristics? Just describe it in any terms to yourself.
The most obvious one is it’s just there, isn’t it? It’s living, it’s
just there. Do you have a say in any of those characteristics? Can you
change them? Can you tell them to be otherwise? So while I’m breathing,
and my body is seated, that body that I’m discerning—while the breathing
is there—is independent of me, isn’t it? I can use it, but I cannot
uphold it—I cannot step outside of it and own it. I cannot tell it what
to do. It’s only borrowed, which means everything else that you get
through your body is equally borrowed. And if something is borrowed, is
it right for me to regard it as mine and belonging to me? No. If
something is borrowed, is it right for me to grieve and be sad over it
being taken away? No. You require active ignoring of the fact that
you’re not in control in order to grieve over it or be happy over it.
Hence, mindfulness, if done rightly, results in discernment of the
natural principles, which is what Dhamma is—nature. The nature of
things. You could see how different that is from watching your nostrils
and “belly-bhāvanā”, or whatever they call it. Completely different.
It’s not like thinking: “I’m doing this… I’m feeling my belly rising and
falling, rising and falling…” Zero discernment there. You’re just trying
to attend to the momentary presence of things hoping that it will
magically result in knowledge. Looking for meaning results in knowledge.
Delving with the knife, self-questioning, self-interrogation—all the
things the Buddha talks about in the suttas—that’s what results in
knowledge.</p>
<h4 id="ii.-death-contemplation">II. Death Contemplation</h4>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> What about watching someone die?</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Well, with the right attitude, sure,
but not without the right attitude. Watching someone die and then seeing
that your living body—right here, right now—is more related to that
dying body than to your sense of ownership of your body. It’s in the
same domain as the other dying bodies, not in the domain of your notion
of “this is my body”. That’s how you undermine your control, your sense
of control. You can’t directly choose to not control it or not own it,
but you can undermine it. Hence, seeing that body is impermanent,
because of that, body cannot be the reason for lust and satisfaction,
automatically you experience that body as “not mine”. Sabbe saṇkhārā
anicca, sabbe saṇkhārā dukkha, sabbe dhammā anattā.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> So in Dependent Origination, it says
“With birth, aging &amp; death is”. So this life—this manifestation of
life, what I see as a whole—all that is subject to fading away.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Yes, but that doesn’t need to be
your “subject”, or you don’t need to be subjected to it. You are
subjected to it because you have appropriated birth, you appropriated
the given body, you appropriated the possibilities of the given body and
the senses—you appropriated it by delighting in it, by pursuing
pleasures that are secondary to it, that come on the basis of it. You
can’t engage in sensual pleasure without appropriation of the body, it’s
inconceivable. So through engaging in sensual pleasure, you’re
responsible for your appropriation of the body. And then, you’re liable
to whatever that body is liable to: accidents, aging, death, sickness,
all of it. Hence, it’s on you, because you took it, through carelessly
pursuing sensuality.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> The body will always age and will
always die.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Yes, but if you stop regarding it as
yours, it’s not your problem. Inasmuch as these aging trees and other
people’s bodies are not your problem because they’re not yours. That’s
why they’re not your problem. It’s not that they’re not your problem
because they’re other people’s. They’re not your problem because you
never considered other people to be yours—but, incidentally, say if it’s
your son, your daughter, your partner, suddenly you’re emotionally
affected. Why? Because they’re “yours”. So yes, you can appropriate
other people as well. Your friends, for example. And that’s why you
suffer. Not because they’re dying, you suffer because you appropriated
them and now you’re feeling that because you’re liable to it. So you
have a choice. If you want to be free from suffering, you have to give
up all the appropriation. If you don’t want to give up the
appropriation, that’s absolutely fine, but then you make yourself liable
to suffering. Again, there is a slight contradiction there, because if
you were to be honest with yourself and ask “Why don’t I want to give up
all the appropriations?” you would answer “Because it’s unpleasant”. So
you’re still governed by the same principle of wanting to avoid
suffering. That’s why people protect their attachments and
appropriations—because they don’t want to suffer. Ironically, you suffer
because of that. If you were to take the initial hit of suffering,
ultimately, you can free yourself from suffering. But if you are too
weak to take the initial hit of suffering, you make yourself liable to
it indefinitely. Either way, nobody wants to suffer. Even people who say
“I want to suffer”, they don’t. They want to suffer because that
provides them pleasure—because not getting that pleasure means actual
suffering. That’s why the Buddha himself could’ve not taught anything
different than suffering and the cessation of it. Because that is at the
root, universally, of every human, regardless of their culture,
education, identity, and whatnot. That is always the basic
principle—avoid pain; have pleasure. Not having enough pleasure, or
getting more pleasure, means avoiding the pain of not having enough
pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> And what do you think about the common
idea where a lot of people say “I’m not afraid of death”?</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Well, they’re not afraid of what
they think death is, which means they don’t know what death is. Because
only two people are not afraid of death—a fully enlightened arahant or a
fully deluded puthujjana. But one of them is fully liable to death,
another one is fully free from it. But they both are not afraid of it.
One is not afraid due to the sheer amount of ignorance and not even
knowing what death is, another is not afraid because he’s completely
overcome it. So unless you’re an arahant, you are afraid of death. And
if you don’t feel the fear, it’s because you’re covering it up. Don’t
think that death is what you think death is. Think that death is
basically where you can’t get your pleasures, where you can’t get the
usage of your senses. Find the fears you have in your life, and you’ll
see death is at the other end of them, whatever those fears might
particularly be, or whichever particular way they manifest. Whatever
brings people anxiety, death is on the other side of that. If you say
“I’m not afraid of death, that brings me no anxiety” it’s because your
idea of what death is is completely wrong. But something will be
bringing you anxiety, and that’s what death is, hence the anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> One might say: “I’m afraid of losing
all my friends”.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Well, there you go. Death is at the
other end of that. That’s just a hint of where death is. Not having
anyone, being all alone, losing it all. Or simply losing things that are
dear to you. Or even more simply, as the Buddha said, being separated
from the agreeable, and being united with the disagreeable. That’s what
suffering is. And the ultimate suffering is death. You might think: “I’m
not afraid of dying, but I’m afraid of what people think about me”.
There you go. Death is basically not having a say in what people will
think about you ultimately. That’s the most frightening thing, isn’t it?
Well, for those who fear that. Or you might think: “I’m not afraid of
dying, but I’m afraid of losing my wealth,”I’m afraid of losing my
family.”</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> Or “I’m afraid of public
speaking”.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> And you ask yourself why is that?
Because it’s the ultimate experience of non-control. You have control
over your speaking, but you have zero control over how people will take
that—what will they say? What will they think?</p>
<p>So, ultimately, what is the fear of death? It’s fear of the ultimate
non-control. And it’s not incidental that one thing or the other will
have to be reminding you of that, because the whole human experience is
about covering the fact that you’re not in control, covering the fact
that you’re liable to dying, inevitably liable to dying. So all these
things, loss, public speaking, whatever frightens people, frightens them
because it’s the ultimate reminder of the cessation of any notion of
control they might have. So if people say “I’m not afraid of dying”,
it’s because that thought is in their control, and they think that’s
what dying is. So they’re not afraid of it. They think: “Everybody
dies”. True. But why are you afraid of public speaking? Everybody
speaks, yet here you are, terrified of public speaking. Why? Because you
are constantly looking away from the fact that you’re not in control.
And when you encounter experiences where you cannot ignore that fact
that you’re not in control, it frightens the hell out of you. And that’s
what death is—the ultimate cessation of any ground for your notion of
control that you take to be the most fundamental thing. “I am, therefore
things are mine, therefore I’m in control”.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> So anattā is basically seeing
death.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Yes, seeing death, sure. Seeing
death correctly means not being able to entertain the notion of control,
which means not being my own self, not being my self, not belonging to
me, non appropriation—that’s all anattā.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> So if I see that for myself…</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> It’s going to scare the hell out of
you. That’s what happened in the suttas. If today people are not scared
when they read about anattā* and <em>nibbāna</em>, it’s because they
don’t have a clue what it is, what it really is. So for a
<em>puthujjana</em>, <em>nibbāna</em> is closer to what death is, the
one that he’s ignoring. So a <em>puthujjana</em>, through ignoring
death, actually ignores the possibility of <em>nibbāna</em>. That’s why
those people who came to the Buddha, the way the Buddha would lay it out
on them, they couldn’t ignore it and would fall on the ground in
complete anxious despair and have a mental breakdown. Saying: “This will
kill me! This will destroy me!”. Because they still gratuitously assume
the priority of their sense of “I am”, despite the evidence showing the
contrary. They think: “I’m not giving up the notion of ‘I am’, thus I
will be destroyed.” But if you hear the teaching, you realize that could
have not been yours even if you wanted it to, and the only reason you
were regarding it as yours is because you didn’t know that it cannot be
yours. And how do you find out that it cannot be yours? Through
practicing mindfulness correctly and seeing that it is inseparable from
the necessary basis of things that cannot be yours.</p>
<p>Dwelling on the characteristics of the necessity of the body, the
independence of the presently enduring feeling, presently enduring
perceptions, yet seeing yourself inseparable from it. That means,
basically, re-molding, re-shaping, going against the grain, and forcing
yourself to see that your own self depends on a basis that cannot be
your self. Because if it were so, the body would not age, would not get
sick and would not die. If it were so, the feelings would not
change—they would always be pleasant, the way you want them to. Yet the
Buddha said: “If that feeling is yours, which one is it? Why do you
experience displeasure if feeling is yours?” You wouldn’t do so if you
were in control. So through reminding yourself that you’re not in
control—through practicing <em>maranānussati</em> correctly—you get to
undermine your sense of self gradually so that you won’t freak out and
have a breakdown, although some monks did, that’s why the Buddha told
them to do mindfulness of breathing instead. Because if done rightly, it
results in the same principles being discerned.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> So if you were truly unafraid of
death, how would you take other people’s deaths?</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Equably. Equally unafraid of it. You
would not be oblivious to what’s happening, like some sort of robot who
lost the significance of things. It’s still your friend dying, but no
amount of the extent of that experience—perception and feeling in regard
to it—can overturn your mind and make you think that which isn’t yours
is, or that which isn’t permanent is. The only attitude you could
possibly have is “how could it be otherwise?”. How can something that’s
been born and grown not die? It’s actually insanity to think otherwise.
So grieving over death is on the level of insanity. Because it’s
inconceivable for somebody who understood the nature of death to think
“But if only…” It just doesn’t apply. How can it be otherwise?</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> But you have to get used to this,
because I think it’d be difficult to do it while you’re dying…</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Oh, good luck with that. If you’ve
never done it while you were alive—if you haven’t uncovered the nature
of death while you were alive—you’re not going to do it when you’re
dying. It’s too late. So you want to start facing it as soon as you can.
That’s why, basically, understanding of death, understanding of the
ultimate non-control, means ultimately giving things up—relinquishing
appropriation and assumption. That’s why understanding that fully means
nibbāna. That’s why a Sotāpanna, who understood the nature of nibbāna,
or an ariyasāvaka in general, is often spoken about in the suttas as “If
he doesn’t attain it during his life, he attains when he’s dying”. Why?
Because that’s where it comes from, the direction of dying and cessation
of control. Now, if he got careless and lazy during his lifetime and
hasn’t been making the effort, death will force him in the direction
that he already understood. That’s why sometimes ariyasāvaka can become
an arahant at the moment of dying—it’s not some mystical light that
appears before you die. It’s the direction you understood through your
Right View and everything else, and now you’re dragged there, and you
already understood it, so you’re dragged where you should have gone
while you were still alive. So it’s still good to understand it, but
it’s even better to do it now and not wait to be dragged there by death,
even for ariyasāvakas.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> It reminds me of that sutta that says
“See as though blind”—as though you were already blind.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Right. Well, see as though you
already relinquished your sight. That’s what it means. Doesn’t mean to
pretend you’re blind and not seeing, because what you’re seeing was
never a problem―it was because of you owning your eyes and what comes
through, that you were affected by everything else that’s experienced on
account of it. So if you don’t forget that the necessary basis for any
sight you have is the physical organs of your eye that you’re not in
control of, that will ultimately be diminished and destroyed, you cannot
possibly have desire toward anything you see. The necessary basis for
the desire toward sights is losing the sight of (no pun intended)―losing
the perspective of the nature of the eye that’s the necessary basis for
any sights. So, ultimately, you’re going to be blind when you die. You
will be deaf when you die. So seeing the ultimate result (death) in
regard to your senses will make you overcome anything that comes through
anything that comes through your senses. But that doesn’t mean you’re
pretending you’re not seeing, which is that wrong view that the man who
talked to the Buddha had, “I’m acting like I’m blind and deaf. I’m
ignoring sights and sounds, I’m pretending I’m not seeing and not
hearing”, and then the Buddha said, “Well, you’re no better than a blind
and a deaf man”. That’s something different. That’s when people blame
the sights and sounds and any other senses for their suffering, failing
to see that suffering is applicable to them because they appropriated
the senses, not because of what comes through them. So are you still
breathing while we’re discussing this particular approach of senses and
eyes and blindness and deafness? Yes. Still the same breath—still the
same basis for your mindfulness enduring for like an hour now. So we’ve
been doing mindfulness of breathing all this time and discerning the
Dhamma within it. On the terms of the universal principles, not on your
own terms. Or as accurately as you can, whichever way you start. That’s
why it says: “He looks at the signs and characteristics”. The features
of this thing. He doesn’t jump at the answers that his mind provides. Am
I breathing? Yes. What would be the characteristics of this breathing?
Characteristics, not mechanical description, such as thinking: “My lungs
are moving…” or whatever—that’s irrelevant. What is the nature of this
act of breathing? Can I stop it when I want to? Well, only relatively
so. Can I make sure it never goes away? No, not really. Do I have a say
in that which is necessary for the act of breathing, the breathing
apparatus? Not in the slightest. If an accident were to happen or a
bacteria or virus were to attack these organs, would I still be able to
breathe as freely? No. So I’m taking for granted that it will be
forever, that it’ll be in my control, that it’ll be unobstructed. Why am
I taking that for granted? Because I’m not thinking sufficiently enough
that I cannot take it for granted. That’s it. What is the condition for
ignorance? It’s ignoring, basically. You stop ignoring, you stop
conditioning your ignorance. Stop ignoring certain universal truths,
that’s it.</p>

<p>“The practice of Dhamma goes against our habits, the truth goes
against our desires, so there is difficulty in the practice. Some things
which we understand as wrong may be right, while the things we take to
be right may be wrong. Why is this? Because our minds are in darkness,
we don’t clearly see the Truth. We don’t really know anything and so are
fooled by people’s lies. They point out what is right as being wrong and
we believe it; that which is wrong, they say is right, and we believe
that. This is because we are not yet our own masters. Our moods lie to
us constantly. We shouldn’t take this mind and its opinions as our
guide, because it doesn’t know the truth.”</p>

<p><strong>Nm:</strong> That is a good example of how differently you
could take what he just said. As he said, obviously you can’t trust your
moods; the starting point is that you don’t have a right reference point
to know right as right, or wrong as wrong. But many people would use
this information to justify dismissing everything, and not committing to
anything, because ‘everything is not sure.’ as sometimes Ajahn Chah
would say.</p>
<p>If you take that last sentence for example: ‘We shouldn’t take this
mind and its opinions to be our guide,’ you can take that to mean:
‘Ah-hah! So I shouldn’t have any views!’ Failing to see that in saying

<p>Yes, you should not commit to any view so that <em>you can keep
looking for the right view</em>. But you should not refuse to commit to
any view as a goal in itself.</p>
<p>Some people think that they can find a way out of views by just
refusing to commit to any views, and that is quite a popular belief.
They might quote people like Ajahn Chah to justify this, but you can see
what a misquote that would be because he does not say that. He says that
your starting point is that you don’t know right as right and wrong as
wrong - that is the <em>puthujjana’s</em> necessary starting point. What
you need to do from that starting point is to make the effort to clarify
things for yourself - not make an effort to refuse to commit to anything
because everything is seen as risky and dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Continuation of the Ajahn Chah passage:</strong></p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Some people don’t want to listen to others at all, but this is not
the way of a man of wisdom.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> You really want to take that seriously. People
might think ‘Oh sure, I have no problem listening to others.’ But ask
yourself: can I be mentally disturbed by hearing someone else’s view?
For example, if you have an idea of what the practice of Dhamma is, and
now somebody challenges this; or simply has a different view to yours -
ask yourself: “Would I be affected by that? Am I threatened, do I feel a
need to defend myself, or even justify myself - to myself? I might not
necessarily get into an argument with someone, but am I personally
affected by the opposing view, whether by doubt, unrest, or
similar?”</p>
<p>If the answer is yes, that is what that means: you don’t want to hear
others, which is why you are not wise nor developing wisdom. There is
absolutely no reason to be affected by anything, let alone for someone
else’s view to give rise to emotion in you. There is no justification
for it. You do not learn by going and debating with everyone, you learn
by understanding right as right, wrong as wrong. But if you keep
protecting whatever you have, out of fear of perhaps being wrong, it
means you will never know wrong as wrong and right as right, because you
are not committing to learning it.</p>
<p><strong>Continuation of passage:</strong></p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“A wise man listens to everything. One who listens to Dhamma must
listen just the same, whether he likes it or not, and not blindly
believe or disbelieve. He must stay at the half-way mark, the middle
point, and not be heedless. He just listens and then contemplates and
sees the cause and effect for himself before he believes what he
hears.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> He listens and he understands what that thing is
saying, understands the meaning of it. That is exactly how he can know
whether it is right or not, whether it is according to the Dhamma or
not. And how can you understand the meaning of something if you never
make the effort to understand it?</p>
<p><strong>Continuation of passage:</strong></p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Even if the teacher speaks the truth, don’t just believe it, because
you don’t yet know the truth of it for yourself.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> You need to understand it for yourself. Not “see
it for yourself” in the sense of having some kind of mystical experience
- no you need to <em>understand</em> it. The aim is not to have some
completely inexpressible, idiosyncratic experience that nobody can
relate to but somehow “it’s my truth”. That is simply a mystical
experience, that’s the only “truth” of it, while what needs to be
understood is the universal nature of <em>all</em> experience that
applies to all beings, consisting of the five aggregates.</p>
<p>That is why that understanding is what frees you, and everyone can
relate to it, always. The Dhamma doesn’t change, in the sense that the
universal principles remain the same regardless of whether the path is
revealed or not. But it cannot be revealed to you if you are not making
an effort to discern it; it cannot occur accidentally or spontaneously.
An experience that you can’t explain or put in words may indeed be real,
as such: a real mystical experience. But if you can’t put it into words,
you have not understood it.</p>

sense restraint, and think that simply by practicing restraint you are
going against the grain, against your habits. But there he is really
talking about the views, not only sense restraint; that’s an important
difference. How many people actively challenge their own existential
views, invite on existential doubt in order to uproot it? Not many. Many
people can live a restrained life, but that does not differentiate a
person from a restrained householder: only the right view does. For the
right view, being a renunciate is not enough; you must challenge your
views.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>When you say ‘if you don’t have right view,
you don’t know’ – this might give the impression that since we don’t
know, we can’t really claim to understand anything by ourselves and we
are probably in the wrong, so should therefore have to simply have faith
in somebody else who says they have the right view.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Being aware that you do not have the right view
does not justify you following someone blindly, regardless if that
person has the right view or not. “Challenging your views” does not
equate to just doing what a teacher tells you to do, without reading the
suttas, without thinking for yourself. Even if that teacher is himself
an <em>arahant</em>, that is not enough for you to become one. You
cannot just “do what he tells you to do” with the expectation that this
will automatically give results.</p>
<p>So even if it is your own teacher and somebody who does know what
they are talking about, you must investigate that. (You must take
responsibility for the views that you hold, regardless of how you have
acquired them or from whom you have heard them)</p>
<p>I can give you verbatim instruction and you can go through exactly
the same motions as I do, but if your attitude is one of not accepting
responsibility, nothing will work because there is no Dhamma there! You
going through these motions will be literally just motions, without
Dhamma.</p>

right track, because it will make you complacent to that extent. If you
are aiming for and content with anything lower than the Right view, you
can expect a result even lower than that. You should really be aiming
for higher, so that at least you might get the Right view as a

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What about this “mundane” or ordinary right
view, isn’t this also a kind of a right view?</em></p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> The Right view I was referring to is the Right
view of a <em>sotāpanna</em>; freedom from suffering. The mundane right
view doesn’t free you from suffering, it is a right basis for the noble
Right view. That doesn’t mean that it doesn’t count or doesn’t matter –
you can’t have the Right view of a <em>sotāpanna</em> without the
mundane right view. But in having the mundane right view, you are still
a <em>puthujjana</em>.</p>
<p>(At the same time, the mundane right view shouldn’t be underestimated
or taken for granted.) Most practitioners, even supposedly serious
Buddhist practitioners, don’t even have the mundane right view. If you
start thinking about the mundane right view and take it seriously, you
realise it is already quite an accomplishment in undoing lots of wrong
views, and it involves developing quite a lot of self-transparency, and
recognition of the nature of things.</p>
<p>The mundane right view is basically about authenticity and
self-transparency: recognition of the validity of an arisen thing as a
phenomena. ‘There is good and bad, mother and father, there is this life
and the next life’ - there is the fact that I don’t know something!</p>
<p>All these things represent a certain threshold of recognising how
things genuinely appear, how things are, that is not overly interpreted
in a materialistic way, nor mystified. The basis of the arisen
experience – as a starting point. Not coming out of a view that you have
preconceived. “There IS Rebirth! – because I believe in it, not because
I see it.” Or equally, “There is NO Rebirth – because I don’t believe in
it, not because I see it.” What you have to recognise first is the fact
that “I don’t know” - lack of knowledge as a factual thing, an arisen
thing.</p>
<p>(The wrong view is rarely very obvious or explicitly stated.) People
might say for example, “Oh yes of course there is mother, there is
father,” but then when you ask them more, they will immediately jump
onto the view of modern science and medicine and talk about how “sure,
it looks like a mother or father, but in <em>reality</em> it’s just a
bunch of atoms and electrons and in reality there is nothing there, just
all these atoms and electrons constantly changing.”</p>
<p>It is also common to use this to explain why “everything is changing,
everything is impermanent,” and you often hear people saying that modern
science is proving that the Buddha’s teaching is correct - though that
has nothing to do with the Buddha’s teaching whatsoever. You can see
that view even among fully committed Buddhist practitioners, undermining
the basic reality of the world that they themselves have experienced.
You can’t avoid that basic reality but you can certainly misinterpret it
and cover it up with your view. One who does this doesn’t even have a
mundane right view, because their views deny the basic, “mundane”
aspects of their experience.</p>
<p>That is what it means to say “there is mother, there is father” –
that’s it, there is no lower threshold than that [for what is real or
true] in your experience. For example, take an emotionally charged
experience like your father getting sick. Most people’s practice is
about <em>covering up</em> even that basic starting point – far from
recognising it – because it bothers them. The practice becomes
management of what already bothers you, and the management is done
through the wrong views: e.g. ‘Well, fundamentally it is just a
collection of atoms…’ – which is just another way of saying
‘fundamentally, in reality, there is no father.’</p>
<p>But in reality your father is there, that is your starting point –
and if you start thinking like that, your practice <em>cannot</em> be
management, it can only result in uprooting the problem in the first
place. You have no leeway, no way out, of denying the things that are
there, that already bother you – experience of mother, experience of
father, experience of doubt. These are the arisen, factually enduring,
present states of your mind. And if you practice the Dhamma rightly,
they will not be able to bother you in the first place – so there is no
need, no reason for you to deny your mother, your father, divine realms…
Why would you?</p>
<p>The only reason people deny them is that they don’t know the way out
of suffering.</p>
<p>When you start to recognise things just as they are in your
experience – “this is the experience of having a mother, this is the
experience of having a father; this is the experience of doubt; this is
the experience of sensuality” – you are already starting to withdraw
yourself from the material content of those things that we are all so
focused on. That is the necessary basis for starting to discern the
signs of the mind as phenomena.</p>
<p>On the other hand, having these preconceived views prevents you from
seeing your own mind as a thing that has arisen, which is a prerequisite
for the arising of the Right view (<em>citta-nimitta</em>). How can you
see your mind as an enduring thing, when with your views you are denying
even obvious enduring things? You need the mundane right view as a basis
for seeing things that matter; mind, feeling, intentions. Then the
impermanence you discern within that is the impermanence of ownership,
the impossibility to be a controller-master of things, the impermanence
of your sense of self. Not the impermanence of a random stone, tree,
table, etc.</p>
<p>What defines wrong view as a wrong view is that it contradicts the
universal aspects of your own experience. The Buddha did not ‘invent’
the Right view, he just discerned it on the right terms. But to see it,
you do need the right instruction and you will never accidentally arrive
at it, because everything points in the wrong direction.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What about the experience of kamma and
vipaka, we don’t have this experience?</em></p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> The Buddha never said to figure out and settle
all the details of ‘how <em>kamma</em> and <em>vipaka</em> works’ – he
actually said:</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“The results of action (kammavipako), monks, are incalculable, and
not to be calculated. One who tries to calculate them will become mad or
frustrated.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>– <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.77">AN 4.77</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what you can recognise is that very possibility, that very
uncertainty: ‘I don’t know to what extent my actions will bear fruit.’
That is your factual experience right here and now. How would you act
then, if you are not dismissing <em>kamma</em>, nor having a perfectly
clear-cut template of how <em>kamma</em> works? You realise that ‘I
don’t actually know – so I had _better be very carefu_l, since even when
I think something might not be a problem, I don’t know for myself so it
is not worth the risk.’</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Part of the mundane right view says ‘there
are in the world good and virtuous recluses and brahmins who have
realised for themselves by direct knowledge and declare this world and
the other world.’</em></p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: Again, it is important to recognise that
<em>possibility</em> of direct knowledge as a real thing. Usually,
almost automatically, people start denying the basic manifestation of
things, and they end up with the view of ‘there is nothing truly to be
attained.’ If you take the view that nothing can be trusted, you don’t
commit to anything, then it follows naturally ‘What, <em>sotāpanna</em>?
No, no, nothing to be attained anyway, that’s more attachment, the more
you practice the less you know’ and so on.</p>
<p>Thinking like this, you won’t even feel responsible for not becoming
a <em>sotāpanna</em>, instead you deny it so that you don’t feel obliged
to do it.</p>
<p>It always comes back to accepting responsibility. It is possible to
be free from suffering – that possibility is present in everyone’s
experience right here and now. It always was, always will be. There is
possibility of direct knowledge – so that means there is <em>my</em>
possibility of direct knowledge, possibility of <em>my</em> awakening.
So what do you then do with that?</p>
<p>You can see: ‘there is a possibility to be free – and I am perfectly
free to decide <em>not</em> to go that way – but then I will also be
perfectly responsible for not getting the results of it.’ That is the
first thing that hit me when I started reading the suttas as a layman.
When the Buddha said:</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Bhikkhus, both formerly and now, what I make known is suffering and
the cessation of suffering.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>– <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn22">MN 22</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had never even found somebody saying that, but now finally somebody
directly said it, and I felt that: ‘I don’t have to follow it. I could
go the other way. But if I choose not to become a monk and practice
this, I am fully responsible for whatever happens to me for the rest of
my life, even if it is ’not my fault’ in lay terms.’</p>
<p>I couldn’t ignore that. I would be responsible for even things that
are completely out of my control – good or bad - if I were to choose to
stay in the domain where they can happen. There is the world, there is
freedom from the world. When you choose the world, the realm of Mara,
you choose everything that comes with it – on account of that choice to
not renounce it.</p>
<p>How can a person, without fully acknowledging that choice and taking
that responsibility – how can he then take the practice seriously? He
can’t. His practice will have a magical connection to the result. ‘I’m
devotional, I meditate, I respect tradition, I watch my nostrils and the
soles of my feet, and then Enlightenment will <em>happen to me</em> on
account of these observances and duties that I do.’</p>
<p>Enlightenment cannot ‘happen to you’ – you can only develop it. In
order to develop it, you need to understand what it is – and how can you
understand what it is if you are denying the basic possibility of it, in
the first place?</p>
<p>As Nanavira said,</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“So long as you are content to put the sotāpanna on a pedestal well
out of reach, it can never possibly occur to you that it is your duty to
become sotāpanna yourself (or at least to make the attempt) here and now
in this very life; for you will simply take it as axiomatic that you
cannot succeed…you are not required to admire a sotāpanna, but to become
one.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>https://nanavira.org/index.php/letters/post-sotapatti/1963/102-l-50-19-may-1963</p>
<p>It is a hard thing to do and the only way to do it is to fully accept
responsibility for not doing it. If you are not free from suffering,
it’s on you. If you are free from suffering, it’s also on you. So you
have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Some people say that they cannot become
arahant in this lifetime because of their kamma.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> People say that when they talk about
<em>kamma</em> factually and try to use kamma that they can’t even
remember as an excuse for doing nothing now. Actually it wouldn’t work,
even if you had a memory of it – let alone if you don’t have a memory of
it. If that is your <em>kamma</em> from before, it is the same as a
<em>kamma</em> from yesterday – what you have done yesterday, ten years
ago, - all are equally your <em>kamma</em>, why stop then? You choose to
draw this invisible line where your memory is – ‘Oh, I don’t remember,
so it’s not my problem (if it somehow causes me to not become an
<em>arahant</em> now.)’. You actually want to go the other way – I can’t
remember, thus it is a big problem and definitely my problem.</p>
<p>Lack of memory should make you responsible for everything. If you do
something today because ten years ago you started developing a certain
habit, you would not be able to deny responsibility for it, as you have
a memory of it. What that means is that if you can’t practice properly
now because of something you did ten lifetimes ago, that still simply
means that you can’t practice properly because of yourself. So ‘I can’t
become an <em>arahant</em> because of my previous <em>kamma</em>’ just
means ‘I can’t become an <em>arahant</em> because I can’t become an
<em>arahant</em>.’ That’s the reason in itself.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>I think it is connected to what you mentioned
before about the observances. Someone follows some practice and
observance without the results…</em></p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> They would end up with an excuse that relieves
them of responsibility instead of thinking ‘wait, maybe I’ve been doing
something wrong!’</p>
<p>No – I couldn’t have been doing something wrong because it would mean
my efforts have been wasted, but that is too unpleasant to admit, so
instead I’ll just dismiss it, I’ll say ‘No, I’m doing everything
<em>right</em>, but I cannot get to it because of something in the past,
that I have no memory of.’</p>
<p>If you have no memory of something, it is the same as saying it
doesn’t exist for you – yet that which doesn’t exist for you, you have
no knowledge, no memory, no perception of it, you still take it as a
presently perceived reason for your failure. You can see what a deeply
rooted act of self-deception that is.</p>
<p>So you can wear robes throughout your whole life, yet still not even
have the mundane right view. And that is nobody else’s fault. You are
always solely responsible for the views you hold, and nothing you do
will make any difference if there is not even a mundane acceptance of
responsibility and transparency in regard to your own life, your own
actions.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean just repeating it theoretically ‘yes, I’m
responsible!’</p>
<p>It means that you must <em>feel</em> it – you must feel that
existential anxiety. There is no other way around it, though you can
suffer to different degrees on account of it, depending on your
development of proper virtue and <em>samadhi</em>. Nonetheless, it is
still the same thing that needs to be done.</p>
<p>Only when you start accepting this, can you realise that the practice
of Dhamma is not optional; that it’s not up to anyone else - any
external form, method, guide or institution; and that it doesn’t manage
your suffering, it uproots the basis of it. In other words, it is only
about oneself being free from craving, or not free from craving.</p>
<p>When the suffering is uprooted there is nothing to manage, thus you
are free from any burden, duty, and no reason to do anything anymore.
But you will not arrive at that through blindly adhering to the
dependence on needing something to do.</p>
<h4 id="sīlabbataparāmāsa">Sīlabbataparāmāsa</h4>
<p>That is what <em>sīlabbataparāmāsa</em> means – not rites and
rituals, or things that are very obviously ridiculous when it comes to
practice. ‘Virtue’ (sīla) and duty, sense of duty, something you need to
do.</p>
<p>For example, one might take for granted that ‘it’s my duty to sit
cross-legged and meditate as a monk.’ – Yes, but why do you do it? Why
does it help you? Do you understand why it helps you and why you are
doing it? No, you are just doing it because ‘it is my duty to do this,
and my virtue is also my duty.’</p>
<p>That is a fetter. How can you abandon that fetter – <em>without</em>
abandoning your virtue and without abandoning your efforts?</p>
<p>What differentiates it is that when it is taken as a duty, you bypass
responsibility - at least a little bit. For example, a judge when
sending someone to jail will not see it as <em>his</em> decision, his
choice, his responsibility for putting someone in jail: ‘I’m a judge,
it’s my duty to pass a judgement on you.’ Well, you chose to be a judge,
the one who sends someone to jail. You introduce a proxy to cover up the
fact that it is <em>you</em> condemning people to die, or not.</p>
<p>One can say ‘I need a job, I have to work’ – and yes you do, because
you have six children, resulting from things that you yourself wanted to
do. But even if somebody had forced those children on you and you had to
look after them, it couldn’t truly be a duty. You would still be free to
accept it or not.</p>
<p>That is the initial realisation involved in accepting responsibility:
‘Oh, so I could then decide to not do it.’ A whim of thought can change
the direction of your whole existence. And that is very scary. No matter
which way your life went and what you invested in it, one morning you
can decide to wake up and leave it all.</p>
<p>Having that edge constantly present freaks people out, because the
mind is undeveloped and unrestrained, without a basis of proper virtue
and self-control. Just a sight of that edge makes people run in
terror.</p>
<p>So instead they just go from one authority to the next authority.
Monks - when they ordain end up turning to <em>vinaya</em>, rules, their
duty and so on, to the point of becoming extremely neurotic, whereby
they are following and holding on to what is not even <em>vinaya</em>
anymore; but some extreme, ridiculous interpretation upon
interpretation. Although the rule is clear; the context is clear,
everything is clear, someone can’t sleep for five days because of the
worry (that they might have <em>broken the rule</em>).</p>
<p>That is the problem - through avoiding responsibility you actually
make things worse for yourself. Initially it is much more unpleasant
(and difficult) to accept responsibility for your virtue and see that
<em>I am choosing to do this</em>, (as opposed to just ‘this is the
rule.’) But taking responsibility for it yourself is what will enable
you to draw a line for the mind infected with doubt, tempted by Mara.
You can say ‘No – I will not think that, because I know exactly what is
right.’</p>
<p>Even people who blindly adhere to rules and avoid responsibility, do
know exactly what is right. But because they are projected in this
third-person view of duty, something that just <em>must be done</em>
that has nothing to do with me, they also keep needing the third
person’s confirmation that what they are doing is right. The doubt can
only be settled by going around and asking people so that they tell you
what you want to hear – by reading and reading and reinterpreting until
you <em>get</em> from it what you want to hear; by having everyone else
around doing and keeping the same rites and rituals and techniques as
you, because if they don’t it will question the validity of what you do.
<em>Everything is out there, nothing in me, nothing is my
responsibility.</em></p>
<p>That is why someone can be genuinely upset, existentially threatened,
simply by someone else acting in a slightly different way, even as small
as wearing their robe differently. If others don’t do it then you would
realise that you are responsible for assuming that ‘this is what must be
done’. It would bring you back onto that personal responsibility that
you were trying to avoid all along, which is why you latched onto that
fetter of duty and virtue in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>As far as I understand,</em>
sīlabbataparāmāsa <em>is basically about this attitude. So you remove
that attitude, but do not abandon the sīla. You might not see any
difference in the external behaviour of that person.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Exactly, there is no Dhamma without
<em>sīla</em>, but Dhamma is not the <em>sīla</em>. A <em>sotāpanna</em>
doesn’t abandon his <em>sīla</em> to become a <em>sotāpanna</em>, quite
the opposite. But for a person who is fully projected in that
third-person view of things, they can’t see that. For them, if you say
‘Dhamma is not <em>sīla</em>’ it means ‘Oh, so you mean I must not keep
<em>sīla</em> then?’ Removing <em>sīlabbataparāmāsa</em> would seem to
imply that ‘oh, so I should disrobe and go and find a wife.’ No, it
doesn’t mean that at all. Virtue remains unchanged, but your attitude is
now changed. You are no longer doing it on account of the assumed
external authority, or whatever, you are doing it because you see it as
a necessary basis for discerning the phenomena of your mind, intentions,
which you now understand is the way out of suffering.</p>
<p>Unless that responsibility is taken on for what you are doing in the
first place, the wrong things you are doing and the fetters you are
holding, you can never ever uproot them. You deny that as a fetter, you
cannot undo that fetter because you are not seeing it.</p>
<p>Even when you go and practice Dhamma and become a monk, that takes
you even further away from seeing it – instead you just find a niche of
specific things you do now and worldly doings get replaced with ‘what
monks do.’ Yet you are still <em>doing</em> - doing your meditation
technique, doing your methods, and your duties, and you never stop and
think about the contradictions that you carry throughout all that doing.
The existential attitude is the same: <em>I must do this, because if I
don’t do anything I’m going to start sinking.</em> Even when people try
to ‘do nothing’ they end up making it into something i.e. ‘I am going to
Do Nothing Now’ – it just becomes another form of doing. And the most
basic definition of <em>sīlabbataparāmāsa</em> is assuming that
<em>doing certain things</em> will automatically cause purification or
enlightenment.</p>
<p>Only (right) efforts to understand the nature of things contribute to
enlightenment, but you will only know to what extent in hindsight. You
can’t quite tell at the time. Only once you get the Right view can you
see (for example) ‘Yes, it’s all those nights I spent thinking and
pondering relentlessly on the nature of my feelings, intentions, and so
on’. That is the direct way to develop it, but not until you understand.
That is the simile of the axe and the handle – ‘oh look, it’s gone, I
need to replace it! I used it all up, it’s worn out, ignorance is gone.’
*[SN 22.101](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.101)</p>
<p>You can’t <em>do</em> your way out of ignorance. You can only set up
the right kamma, so to speak, (renunciation, sense restraint, so on) –
that provides the basis for understanding the nature of action. In the
same sense, you abandon evil by establishing the good, so that you can
understand both and free yourself.</p>
<p>But people have difficulty accepting that because it makes things
much more overwhelming. First you have to accept responsibility; accept
responsibility for not being a <em>sotāpanna</em> - then have to go
through all that confusion of ‘what do I do then?’ and finally, it is
hard to give up that dependence on having something to do.</p>
<p>Rather than go through all this, the view tends to be: ‘Sure, maybe I
don’t have the Right view, but I’ve been practicing for fifteen years,
surely that cannot have been a waste.’ Surely it counts for something –
simply because you cannot accept the possibility that it might have been
wasted.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Maybe it was not wasted – maybe just a little
bit more…?</em></p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes, but how would you know that? Fifteen years
–a little bit more. If you are honest with yourself, you realise that
you do not know how, in what way, that ‘little bit more’ will help you.
So you are just hoping, using wishful thinking, for magic to happen, to
win the lottery, for you to get the Right view – it’s on the same level.
You would have to realise: ‘actually, I don’t know how what I have been
doing relates to getting the right understanding, because all I have
been doing is <em>doing</em> – of different kinds – I went to this
teacher who told me to do that, another teacher who told me to do this –
I’ve now got my Own Way Of Doing Things – all on the level of depending
on something to do.’</p>
<p>The more you invest in it, the harder it will be for you to look at
it for what it is, to see that you still depend on having something to
do. Having spent thousands of hours in meditation and so on, it becomes
practically impossible to admit that it <em>might</em> have been a waste
of time. Admitting it would equate to breakdown.</p>
<h4 id="sakkāyadiṭṭhi">Sakkāyadiṭṭhi</h4>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>So we have that first fetter,</em>
sakkāyadiṭṭhi <em>(Person-view, personality view) – It is removed for a
sotāpanna, but it seems that craving is still present even for someone
who has removed sakkāyadiṭṭhi.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> <em>Sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em> is on the level of the
view of self, <em>attavāda</em>. You can only know to what extent there
is still craving for the five aggregates, when you are free from
<em>attavāda</em>. A <em>puthujjana</em> can’t get an accurate
representation of what craving is present in a <em>sotāpanna</em>
without becoming a sotāpanna; that is an important thing to keep in
mind. People’s minds are used to having it all laid out – ‘this is what
<em>arahant</em> is, this is what <em>sotāpanna</em> is’ – but you have
to know that if you truly understood what it is, you would be at least a
<em>sotāpanna</em>.</p>
<p>That criteria must not be compromised, because otherwise you would
end up thinking you understood these things without becoming them -
which means there is no understanding of it. In order to free yourself
from <em>attavāda</em>, you have to understand what <em>attavāda</em>
is, and this understanding in itself (i.e. practical discernment, not
merely theoretical understanding) already frees you from
<em>attavāda</em>.</p>
<p>And what is <em>attavāda</em>? It is assuming the sense of self
externally, so to speak.</p>
<p>You can describe to yourself your experience as a whole, which can be
called ‘the five aggregates’. If something is external to it – you
realise ‘how could I even think of that? How could I <em>think</em> of
something external to my thinking?’ That is a complete contradiction in
terms.</p>
<p>But if you become aware of the vague, ambiguous sense of self that
you have, you can see that it kind of has that property (of being
external, independent of or separate from your experience as a whole;
i.e. it is the self that ‘experiences things’ or ‘has the experience.’)
– which means, it is not actually independent, but you keep maintaining
that utter, blatant discrepancy, purely because you never think about
it.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>How I understand it, is that Atta – is
included in your experience and your experience is conditioned by
external things, so to speak, so atta cannot be independent.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> The reason why what you just said is not quite
accurate is that even when you have a thought of how your experience is
externally conditioned – that cannot be <em>that external</em> because
of which your experience is conditioned.</p>
<p>How can you experience that which is beyond your experience, unless
you are experiencing it? If you are experiencing it, it cannot be
external to your experience.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>I mean external to this sense of
‘me’.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Any notion of ‘external’ is fundamentally
internal for you already. That’s how you uproot <em>attavāda</em>. Not
giving it any way out, not leaving any room for that contradiction. Of
course you actually have no choice in the matter, but your view doesn’t
think that. Any form of allowing any form of ‘external to me/my
experience’ is allowing the basis for <em>attavāda</em> to be there. So
even when you say ‘my <em>attavāda</em> is conditioned by external’ you
already assumed ‘external’ independent of your experience and that is
the basis for your very <em>attavāda</em> you are trying to undo.</p>
<p>Regardless of what kind of sense of self you might have – whether
lofty, superior, inferior, far, near, it has to still be within the
aggregates and when you think ‘It’s all within’ even that thought of
‘it’s all within’ is still within the aggregates. That contradiction
cannot remain without that constant nutriment of you providing the basis
for it. Stop providing the basis for it, and the nature of it will
become apparent, after a period of time.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>So it is to basically repeat this same
process of thinking?</em></p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> You can repeat it, it will seem to all make
sense in the beginning, then you might start doubting it, but then you
can find a new way of getting back to it through that very doubt.
Initially a new idea is so inspiring – everything makes sense. As you
keep applying it, that inspiration runs away, and then you start
doubting it and you don’t see it anymore – that is when you have to keep
pushing forward. But that is the idea, yes; developing the theme that
doesn’t provide the basis for any notion of external in regard to your
experience as a whole.</p>
<p>It is not to deny it, ‘There Is No External’ – no – there is
external, which is experienced by you, thought by you, conceived by you,
which means that external is fundamentally internal.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>I realised one thing, that you cannot make
any kind of progress if you keep trying to watch the five aggregates as
if from outside. Because I was trying to watch them, trying to, you
know, see them as impermanent and so on…</em></p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Your watching of the five aggregates is within
the five aggregates. The fact that you keep assuming that you could
‘watch them as if from outside’, means that you still keep allowing the
possibility of ‘external’ and that in itself is already wrong. It is
providing the base for <em>attavāda</em>.</p>
<p>So you can’t simply stop <em>attavāda</em>, but you can stop
maintaining this obvious contradiction of assuming the external through
these little unquestioned attitudes, habits, and thoughts. You undo that
to the extent necessary, there will be no room for <em>attavāda</em>.
Then you can realise that, you can say in a way there is a self, but it
is not yours.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“His very self is not his own.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>–Dhp 62</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s another thing people say: ‘There Is No Self’. That which was
taken as ‘self’ is there; it’s simply these <em>five aggregates</em>,
(which should be seen as not-self). That is what the Buddha said, but
people never arrive at it because their whole practice is based on a
denial: ‘There is No Self’.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“If, Ananda, when I was asked by the wanderer Vaccagotta ‘Is there a
self?’ I had answered ‘There is a self’, would this have been consistent
on my part with the arising of the knowledge that ‘All things are
not-self’?</p>
<p>‘No, venerable sir.’</p>
<p>‘And if, when I was asked by him, ’Is there no self’ I had answered
‘There is no self’ the wanderer Vaccagotta, already confused, would have
fallen into even greater confusion, thinking, ’It seems the self I had
before, now is not there.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>– <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn44.10">SN 44.10</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So already there is the external view of my aggregates as per modern
science and so on; and then this is extended even further with another
layer of wrong view ‘there is no self.’ A denial upon a denial. All of
it is assumed externally which means that you are through and through
<em>attavāda</em>.</p>
<p>First you need to admit that there is that sense of self, then stop
putting it first; stop putting it external to the experience as a whole,
see it within it. Change the order, that is all you need to do.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“It is as if he were putting upright what had been overturned,
revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or
lighting a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see sights –
in this way, Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear to us in many
ways.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>– MN 41 (for example).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can take that in a poetic sense, or in a very literal sense. It
is not to discover new things, but cease perverting the order, messing
them up.</p>
<p>And now somebody can think, ‘oh yes, I get it, I get it!’ Great – but
now develop that theme, day and night. Don’t abandon it. It doesn’t
matter whatever else is going on in your life, don’t abandon the theme
that your sense of self can <em>never</em> be external – including your
very thought of external. You will be literally sucking out the oxygen
that is necessary for that sense of self to keep enduring in that
external manner. There is no basis for it – and if you stop ignoring the
fact that there is no basis for it, it cannot be maintained.</p>
<p>There is nothing mystical about it. But there is nothing scientific
about it either; science is already the wrong view. You need instruction
to know what you need to look for, but now you also need to start
discerning it in your own experience. If now you go with it as your
view, or make a mantra out of it and mechanically think about the
concept or repeat it, you’re not going to be uprooting anything.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Does</em> sotāpanna <em>have
suffering?</em></p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> From an arahant’s point of view yes, from
puthujjana’s point of view, no.</p>
<p>Knowing the way out of suffering means that you can’t suffer. And
that’s what <em>sotāpanna</em> knows; he knows the way out of suffering.
If <em>puthujjana</em> doesn’t accept that as a criteria, he will think
he knows what <em>sotāpanna</em> is, while still being a
<em>puthujjana</em>. And that is a contradiction in terms – the only way
to know what a <em>sotāpanna</em> is, is to become one.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What is that suffering which from the point
of view of an</em> arahant <em>is in</em> sotāpanna <em>?</em></p>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: Symptoms of the illness that linger, while the
illness has been cured. Nuisance. Imagine you were dying of cancer, so
your joints ache, your lymph nodes are swollen, everything is
unpleasant. But really you mentally suffer because you know you are
dying of cancer. Now I come as a doctor and I cure your cancer. But now
your joints still hurt, your lymph nodes are still swollen, you still
don’t have hair – but you know you are free from cancer. You would be
quite joyous actually, you wouldn’t mind any of this discomfort. From
the point of view of someone who is free even from those lingering
symptoms of cancer, yes, you can say that is some sort of suffering. Not
from the point of view of someone who is still in sheer terror of dying
of cancer – who is not even bothered by his symptoms in themselves. His
real bother is the fact that he is dying of cancer. When you uproot
that, the symptoms would bother you even less. That is why
<em>sotāpanna</em> can turn away and go back to a worldly life and still
engage in sensuality. You have uprooted the illness completely and you
fully understand that – it’s not like ‘oh what is happening to me?’ You
know exactly what is happening. No amount of symptoms can re-introduce
the illness.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>He still doesn’t have the full
understanding?</em></p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> He has full understanding but has not dwelt in
the theme of full understanding long enough. In the same sense that I
just described, how to uproot <em>attavāda</em> - you can’t just think
about that theme once or twice, you have to keep discerning it and dwell
in it until the handle of the axe wears out. You don’t know when that
is. For <em>sotāpanna</em> it is even clearer than that, because he
knows exactly what to think and what themes to develop; he just needs to
do it. That is why the Buddha kept encouraging a sense of urgency in
them.</p>
<h2 id="hh--ajahn-chah-and-the-original-mind">71hh- Ajahn Chah and the
Original Mind</h2>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> This is another talk by Ajahn Chah
called “The Path to Peace.” Now, this is just a few paragraphs from it
that I found interesting. In this talk, Ajahn Chah gives a complete
outline of the practice. It’s about the middle of the talk that I’ll
begin from:</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“At a certain point in the practice, you see that it is the mind
which gives orders to the body. The body has to depend on the mind
before it can function. However, the mind itself is constantly subject
to different objects contacting and conditioning it before it can have
any effect on the body. As you continue to turn attention inwards and
reflect on the Dhamma, the wisdom faculty gradually matures, and
eventually, you are left contemplating the mind and mind-objects, which
means that you start to experience the body, rūpadhamma, as arūpadhamma,
formless. Through your insight, you’re no longer uncertain in your
understanding of the body and the way it is. The mind experiences the
body’s physical characteristics as arūpadhamma or formless objects,
which come into contact with the mind. Ultimately, you’re contemplating
just the mind and mind-objects—those objects which come into your
consciousness. Now, examining the true nature of the mind, you can
observe that in its natural state, it has no preoccupations or issues
prevailing upon it. It’s like a piece of cloth or a flag that has been
tied to the end of a pole—as long as it’s on its own and undisturbed,
nothing will happen to it. A leaf on a tree is another example.
Ordinarily, it remains quiet and unperturbed. If it moves or flutters,
this must be due to the wind, an external force. Normally, nothing much
happens to leaves—they remain still. They don’t go looking to get
involved with anything or anybody. When they start to move, it must be
due to the influence of something external, such as the wind, which
makes them swing back and forth. It’s a natural state. The mind is the
same. In it, there exists no loving or hating, nor does it seek to blame
other people. It is independent, existing in a state of purity that is
truly clear, radiant and untarnished. In its pure state, the mind is
peaceful, without happiness or suffering—indeed, not experiencing any
feeling at all. This is the true state of the mind.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> That’s nothing other than seeing
things arise as phenomena, appear as phenomena, which they already are,
because phenomena, i.e. dhammā, are the objects of the mind, of mano, as
a sense. Most people in their day-to-day life don’t even see that
because they’re too absorbed with the sense world, and usually, that
then results in all the views as well. That’s why it’s so common to have
the assumption of the external public world that “we inhabit”—the world
that is independent of our experience, the “material” world; but you
fail to see that even your assumption of “material” is actually a
phenomenon arisen on the level of your thought, on the level of the
dhammā, on the level of the image in your mind. And that’s usually how
people go about in their day-to-day life: not even seeing the mind, the
field where these phenomena appear. So they’ve no signs of it, no
recognition of it. So then everything revolves around the assumptions of
the material world, interpretations based on that and so on.</p>
<p>Again, in itself, it’s still on the level of phenomena, but the only
difference is the person’s completely unaware of it; but a person can
become aware of it. So once you start recognizing that your own body—no
matter how material it is or how material it might “feel”—it still can
only be known as such because it has arisen on the level of that mind.
And in that sense, you realize “This, in a way, has nothing to do with
this matter that I’m thinking of, this matter that I assume; it’s the
opposite way: the matter that I think of and assume is only intelligible
because the thing is still there in the level of that mind as a
phenomenon,” and that’s what Ajahn Chah referred to as arūpa,
non-material. But even a material thing is known as such only because
that phenomenon has arisen on the level of your mind, which is
non-material. So that’s what he meant when he said the mind is the one
that governs and precedes these things structurally.</p>
<p>A person now might start thinking: “So I must find the immaterial” or
something like that. The arūpa that Ajahn Chah refers to—the phenomenal
nature of things—is within the material that you’re perceiving. It’s not
that you must abandon or deny or get rid of the material or stop
thinking it in order to see the immaterial: you just have to discern it
properly whereby you know that the arisen experience of the material
body right here, right now, is an image in your mind already. And that’s
these two tiers of existence, so to speak. Two domains: the simultaneous
presence of the material domain and the mental domain. Material is
inconceivable without the mental designation of it—without the mental
phenomenon being there simultaneously present; but, in the same manner,
there would be nothing present as a phenomenon on the level of the
mental domain if the actual physical rūpa is not there, still alive. So
nāmarūpa determines viññana, and viññana determines nāmarūpa to the same
extent, like the simile of the two reeds supporting each other: you
can’t separate them, you can’t investigate them independent of each
other—one implies the other. That’s just how it works. But in practical
terms, the way the experience proliferates, with lack of sense
restraint, sensuality and views, you drift away from that phenomenal
side of things that’s simultaneously there: you drift away from your
mind. That’s why the Buddha said it’s hard to see the mind correctly for
what it is. That’s why it’s a prerequisite for sotāpatti—seeing the
signs of your mind, seeing the domain of the phenomenal,
phenomenological, whatever you want to call it—because for most people
that’s completely overlooked.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> Do they go directly into the
senses?</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Yes. Usually, the entire attention
gets absorbed, even if you don’t necessarily proliferate it or are not
wild and unrestrained—just naturally—not discerning your mind means
automatically over-discerning that which comes from the senses, which
then influences all the views that you have on account of it, which is
the public material world independent of my experience, science,
scientific measure and data as the objective value. Again, independent
of your experience, failing to see that you cannot even conceive those
things unless they are your experience.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> For example, thinking: “When I die,
this world will continue.”</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Exactly. All the wrong views can be
boiled down to the two fundamental points: “when I die the world will
continue” or “when I die I will continue, not the world.” Either way,
it’s this external projection of your experience as a whole, which is
wrong, not because some higher authority told you it is, but because
it’s a contradiction in terms. How can you even know something external
of your experience if that’s not already experienced? Which means, then,
it’s not external to your experience.</p>
<p>Parts of your experience present themselves based on your ignorance
as if they were independent of your experience, but you’re experiencing
it, and that’s a contradiction in terms. That’s why attavāda is one of
the first contradictions to go when you get the Right View: the
assumption of the external sense of self, independent of this
experience. And that will go when you realize that no matter how
external it might feel, it’s still experienced, which means it’s still
internal in that manner. So it doesn’t matter how material, how
objective it is: the notion of objectivity, the notion of materiality is
on the level of the phenomenon persisting in your mind that gives it
it’s meaning. That’s why things are significant and determined by the
mind. That’s why the mind is the forerunner—as the Buddha would say in
the Dhammapada (verse 1 and 2)—the forerunner of all things: without the
mind giving it’s determination to these things, there would be no
experience; but now if you say “it’s all in the mind”, that’s not true
either because that mind wouldn’t be there mirroring the phenomena if
the matter is not there to be mirrored in the first place, if the four
great elements are not there.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> And it shows that inaccessibility of
that matter to you.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Exactly. The only way you can access
it is the indirect experience of it, which is not it, it exists because
of it.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> And that’s anicca?</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Exactly. That’s why the Mūlapariyāya
Sutta (MN 1) talks about that conceiving: “He conceives in matter,…
apart from matter,…. thinks matter is mine,” and so on. He develops all
these attitudes towards that which is matter, failing to see that he can
only experience his experience of matter, not the matter—so his
perception can only perceive perception, his feeling can only feel
feelings, his intentions can only intend intentions—because assuming
that you’re perceiving the genuine rūpa means you are actually accessing
that external world of the four mahābhūta (the four great elements) and
that’s inconceivable. Hence, the slightest of those assumptions as
described in the Mūlapariyāya Sutta means that there is a conceiving of
“I am.” There is a conceiving of a separate entity that’s independent
and objective from the experience as a whole. That’s why the Buddha
referred to the four great elements, saying: “they cease to find
footing”—they don’t cease to be wherever they are, but they stop finding
footing in your experience. As in you stop conflating the perception
that has arisen on account of the four great elements being there with
the perception of the actual four great elements; but see, now, when you
think: “Oh, so the four great elements are something different”, that’s
also your perception on the level of your thought. So by no means of
grasping—by your thought, by your intentions—can you actually ever enter
the domain of the four great elements. So you realize all you have to do
is stop misconceiving it. That’s how it will stop finding the footing,
not by finding it where it is and removing it and so on: just stop
making the mistake of thinking that you can relate to it. And you will
keep making the mistake of relating to it for as long as you hold your
sense of self dearly because the relations with the world are the direct
result and also direct fuel for the sense of self.</p>
<p>So, if you’re willing to let go of that sense of self, you will then
have no reason to keep maintaining this gratuitous assumption of the
world external to you because the only reason you do that maintenance is
that that’s how you maintain your sense of self.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> What about, as Ajahn Chah is saying,
“the state of the mind”?</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> If you start recognizing that no
amount of materiality or objectivity can be found elsewhere except on
the basis of the mind, you realize the mind is the gateway—it doesn’t
matter what comes your way through your senses, good or bad, threatening
or agreeable and friendly—the mind is the basis, and in itself, on that
basis of the mind, things are quite indifferent. It’s your own attitude,
then, towards what comes through the mind, by not seeing that you want
to deal with it, prevent it, want more of it, indulge in sensuality,
engage in ill-will: because you don’t see that you don’t need to go and
chase these things out there; because even the assumption of “out there”
can only be known as such on the level of the phenomenon of your mind,
which means, you realize: “What if I just know it as a persisting,
enduring phenomenon right here, right now? I don’t need to go anywhere,
I just stay with this framework.” And then there will be no overly
delighting or trying to deny it to get rid of it, which means equanimity
will be a natural result.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> That’s what is there anyway, without
“you”.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Absolutely. The mind and the body
are there without “you”. They don’t need your sense of self. So that’s
why you can develop equanimity. Because things, in themselves, are
equanimous: they’re indifferent to you. It’s your own passion and
confusion—and passion that comes out of that confusion—that confuses
that whole thing; but if you stop fueling that passion, confusion
disappears, which means, then, equanimity is restored because all you
have is things that have arisen and persist, and that’s it. It has
nothing to do with you.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> I’ll continue with Ajahn Chah’s talk,
“The Path to Peace.” He continues:</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“The purpose of practice, then, is to seek inwardly, searching and
investigating until you reach the Original Mind. The Original Mind is
also known as the Pure Mind. The Pure Mind is the mind without
attachment.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> That’s what I just said. You find
the phenomena there, and you realize the phenomena, the way they have
arisen in that mind, are already indifferent, already non-polluted by
passion and lust, and they can’t really be polluted. Your actions can be
polluted by desire and lust, but the persisting phenomenon is still the
way it has arisen, which means it’s impenetrable to your assumptions,
your cravings, your attachments. That’s why it needs constant
maintenance: it can never really get settled in these things that you’re
attached to or trying to get rid of or whatever, it’s only an attitude
in regard to it; but the thing in itself remains completely indifferent.
So you recognize that that true indifference, true equanimity comes from
the things—the way they have arisen—and you have no say, even if you
want to have a say.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> That’s the original state.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Exactly. And then you realize:
“Things were always like this, in a way. It was because I did not know
that they were this way that I kept assuming them to be different.”</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> Ajahn Chah said further:</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“The Pure Mind is the mind without attachment. It doesn’t get
affected by mind-objects. In other words, it doesn’t chase after the
different kinds of pleasant and unpleasant mind-objects. Rather, the
mind is in a state of continuous knowing and wakefulness, thoroughly
mindful of all it’s experiencing. When the mind is like this, no
pleasant or unpleasant mind-objects it experiences will be able to
disturb it. The mind doesn’t become anything. In other words, nothing
can shake it. Why? Because there is awareness. The mind knows itself as
pure. It has evolved its own true independence, has reached its original
state. How is it able to bring this original state into existence?
Through the faculty of mindfulness wisely reflecting and seeing that all
things are merely conditions arising out of the influence of elements,
without any individual being controlling them.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> The mind gives the meaning, gives
the significance, simultaneously, to the present material domain; but
without the material domain, there would be nothing manifesting in the
mind. It’s the two reeds simile holding each other: it’s the “dyad”, as
the Buddha referred to it. And that’s the experience as a whole, back
and front. That’s it. Wherever you look, it’s within these two bases
that are mutually determined.</p>
<p>There is no room for your sense of self, for your ownership, for your
mastery. Or rather, your sense of ownership, as it is now, is within
that, which means it’s determined by that basis independent of your
sense of self. And the sense of self, that’s not in your own control…
Well, that’s not your self, then, is it? Because sense of self
implicitly declares ownership, mastery over experience. That’s why it’s
my self, my own self. So you realize that your own self depends upon
this basis that you’ve no say in, and that’s how your own self is not
yours. You realize the basis that’s not my self, that cannot be my self,
determines this sense of self, and it’s, because of that, not my self.
You actually learn how to perceive not-self with not-self, and that’s
what the Buddha was talking about in those various Suttas.</p>
<p>When Ajahn Chah talks about the “Original Mind”, again, you can
mystify that: you can think “Oh, it’s this pure bright mind that you
just have to tap into.” No, the “Original Mind” is right in front of you
where your thoughts are, where these appearances are. The way things
arise, you realize they have arisen on their own to that extent, and
you’ve no say in that. And that is that “originality” of it: it’s not
your mastery, your creation of those same things. You realize you can
only appropriate things to be “mine” because they were given beforehand:
they’ve arisen on their own so you appropriate them. You realize you
can’t even create anything in that sense; but it’s not like a delay—it’s
not like things have arisen and then you don’t see them—it’s the
simultaneous presence of these things enduring and your ownership of
that endurance, but you want to realize that that endurance cannot be
owned, that’s why you stop owning things. You can’t stop owning things
by trying to destroy them, get rid of them and say no to everything: you
can stop owning them by realizing that your ownership cannot belong to
you. Hence, it’s not ultimate ownership.</p>
<p>That is the “Original”, the “Pure Mind”, as Ajahn Chah said, that
there is no room for anyone there, in a way, means exactly that:
inasmuch as the mind gives a significance and recognition—it allows
matter to manifest on its basis—to that same extent without that matter,
there would be nothing for the mind to discern; so the matter is the
measure of the extent of the mind, and the mind determines the extent of
the appeared matter, and whichever way you look, it’s going to be
determined by the other. So “I am independent of this” becomes
inconceivable to even assume, but in order to see this correctly, a
person has to stop just focusing on things in front of them because
these two levels I talk about, that Ajahn Chah talks about, they’re not
in front of you as two objects. Only one can be in front of you. The
other one is always behind from where you look, and that’s what we spoke
about in other talks: “the peripheral.”</p>
<p>Learning how to see things peripherally without directly looking at
them because that’s where the mind is, that’s where phenomena are. But
what you see in front of you is the objects of your senses. That’s why
people are naturally, with the grain, automatically absorbed with the
world and senses and chasing pleasures: it actually takes effort to
learn how to see the context behind it, how to develop that peripheral
vision without needing to turn away and look at it because it won’t be
peripheral then. Like, I’m looking at you now, and I’ve all these things
peripheral to me, and they will remain peripheral if I keep looking at
you, but if I start looking at that… Well, that’s not peripheral
anymore. Now that’s the actual thing right in front of me. And that’s
the point that you must keep in mind when you try to discern what Ajahn
Chah’s describing here. Rūpa is what you’re staring at, arūpa would be
everything around it. You want to learn how to see arūpa as arūpa; you
want to see the peripheral as peripheral.</p>
<p>By the way, rūpa and arūpa are not quite used in this sense in the
Suttas, but Ajahn Chah used it on a practical level, and there’s nothing
wrong with that.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> So I’ll continue with the talk:</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“This is how it is with the happiness and suffering we experience.
When these mental states arise, they’re just happiness and suffering.
There’s no owner of the happiness. The mind is not the owner of the
suffering—mental states do not belong to the mind. Look at it for
yourself. In reality, these are not affairs of the mind, they’re
separate and distinct. Happiness is just the state of happiness;
suffering is just the state of suffering.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Any phenomenon is a phenomenon in
itself; that’s why it’s independent of you. That’s why the Suttas say:
“He knows the mind affected with lust as mind affected with lust.” It’s
not like “me affected with lust.” There is lust present; there is
non-lust present. There is happiness present; there is sadness present.
It’s enduring inasmuch as sights are enduring, sounds are enduring and
so on. Anything that manifests, that is its nature: to be manifested.
That’s it. So even if it’s a weird, ambiguous thought, it’s real as
such: as the experience of an ambiguous thought. But it’s our own
expectation of “concreteness” which is fueled by that assumption of
“material, public concreteness”, so to speak, —the world independent of
me— that prevents you from seeing the mind, seeing the phenomena, seeing
the Dhamma. That’s why dhammā means, literally, “phenomena”. And then
the Dhamma is the teaching of the knowledge of the phenomena, of that
which manifests.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> It’s right there.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Yes, it cannot be anywhere else. So
it’s learning how to see it correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> Ajahn Chah says:</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“You are merely the knower of these things. In the past, because the
roots of greed, hatred, and delusion already existed in the mind,
whenever you caught sight of the slightest pleasant or unpleasant
mind-object, the mind would react immediately—you would take hold of it
and have to experience either happiness or suffering. You would be
continuously indulging in states of happiness and suffering. That’s the
way it is as long as the mind doesn’t know itself—as long as it’s not
bright and illuminated. The mind is not free. It is influenced by
whatever mind-objects it experiences. In other words, it is without a
refuge, unable to truly depend on itself. You receive a pleasant mental
impression and get into a good mood. The mind forgets itself. In
contrast, the original mind is beyond good and bad. This is the original
nature of the mind. If you feel happy over experiencing a pleasant
mind-object, that is delusion. If you feel unhappy over experiencing an
unpleasant mind-object, that is delusion. Unpleasant mind-objects make
you suffer and pleasant ones make you happy—this is the world.
Mind-objects come with the world. They are the world. They give rise to
happiness and suffering, good and evil, and everything that is subject
to impermanence and uncertainty. When you separate from the original
mind, everything becomes uncertain—there is just unending birth and
death, uncertainty and apprehensiveness, suffering and hardship.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Yes, and you’re separated from the
“Original Mind”—you’re separated from that domain of phenomena, you
don’t see them as phenomena—when you never restrain your actions in
regard to your senses. The threshold of the being you are used to is on
the level of the senses and the pleasure or pain that comes from it.
That’s why many people would have the implicit attitude that even their
own thoughts don’t really exist, are not real: because the expectation
of reality has been proliferated so far out.</p>
<p>Going back to that “Original Mind”, as Ajahn Chah says, is not some
hidden reality behind all these appearances: it’s actually stopping to
misconceive the appearances for what they’re not, and that is its
original state. It was always there. That’s why arahantship is possible
in the first place. That’s why undoing of the wrong conceiving is
possible: because these things are truly independent of whether you
conceive them or not. So that’s why the sense of self is a problem:
because it’s a contradiction in terms. “Self” means mastery, ownership,
rulership of your experience. Yet you can only rule that which was given
to you beforehand, which means you’re not the ruler then because if you
were the true creator, master, ruler of these things, you would have
been creating it, you would have been truly independent of it. But your
whole existence depends on these things still being there so that you
can maintain your ownership in regard to it; but when that thing decides
to go, and it will—that’s why the Buddha encouraged reflecting on the
four great elements, how they change—you realize it’s inconceivable that
you would still exist in your domain of ownership. So, that’s not
ownership then, and you realize the only way to maintain that sense of
ownership of things around you is to ignore the fact that you cannot
actually own it. That’s why people don’t want to think about death
naturally—don’t want to think about losing their loved ones, losing
things they care about—because it’s implicit that it will happen, so it
just reminds them of the obvious. So you stop being ignorant by making
an effort to not ignore things. That’s it. Because ignoring things is
effortless. It’s with the grain of sensuality, the grain of ignorance;
not ignoring takes effort. But not ignoring is not like “resolving some
mystery of the universe.” You just need to stop ignoring the very things
that are in front of you: stop ignoring the broader context; stop
ignoring the peripheral to the actual; stop trying to get rid of the
states of mind you don’t like or that “should have not arisen.”</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Thaniyo:</strong> You can just look at
“mind-objects.”</p>
<p><strong>Ven. Nyanamoli:</strong> Yes. That’s what we do when we do
the questioning, asking: “How am I feeling right now, fundamentally? Is
it OK or is it not OK?” And you realize you find that a state there
enduring, and you have no say in it. You may have lots of joy now
because you feel OK, or you have a bit of a pressure and unpleasant
feeling because you don’t feel OK, but that fundamental bit of whether
it’s OK or not OK has arisen on its own. Feeling has been manifested to
its own extent, and you have no say in that. That’s why I compare it to
the weather that comes and goes. You will act differently when the
weather’s bad, you’ll act differently when the weather’s good. In the
same way, you’ll act differently when there is a pleasant feeling than
when there is an unpleasant feeling, but that in itself is not
necessarily the problem until your actions delude you into believing
that they are the controller of the weather: they are the controller of
the feelings. And that’s why the Buddha would ask that person in that
Sutta: “Well, if the feeling is truly yours (as in you’re the
controller), which one is it then?” because they keep coming and going.
Good feelings, bad feelings, neutral feelings, but if you were truly the
owner, you would only have good feelings because ownership and pleasure
go hand in hand. That’s why you want to undermine that pleasure, not by
trying to get rid of it, but seeing that it cannot actually be yours—it
hasn’t come from you. That’s how you also undermine the ownership.</p>
<h2 id="hh--dont-be-faithful-to-ignorance">83hh- Don’t Be Faithful to
Ignorance</h2>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> I was wondering if we could speak about
lying, the phenomenon of lying, the choice to lie. A simple question: Is
it wrong to lie? Where can we go with that?</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> It is. So now you may ask why is it wrong
to lie? Don’t just take it as true because an authority ‘declared’ that
lying is wrong and now you must obey that. Yes, lying is wrong, but you
want to investigate why it is wrong. So, what’s the first, most obvious
thing that shows itself if you start to investigate why lying would be
wrong? What is lying?</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> Dishonesty.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> OK, so dishonesty, lying, concealing.
What do all those things have in common?</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> The person not wanting something to be
known.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Exactly, which means there is something,
but you want it to be different. So, in its nature, it’s a discrepancy,
a contradiction—two opposing things: one is the truth, the other is what
you would prefer it to be.</p>
<p>But the problem with lying is—phenomenologically speaking, from the
point of view of a person who practices mindfulness and tries to develop
wisdom—that you cannot deny the truth without giving importance to your
point of view over the truth. That’s why lying is practically
wrong—lying is practically an obstacle for developing wisdom. If you
could, say, theoretically, lie without perverting that existential order
of truth and your point of view, then lying would not be unwholesome.
But it is impossible to engage in an act of lying without implicitly,
immediately fueling the wrong order, whereby it’s my point of view, my
preference that comes first—truth is second.</p>
<p>When I say truth, I mean factual presence of a self-arisen
phenomenon, and that’s the key here—it’s not like ‘the Truth’, as in
there is ‘a lie’ and then there is ‘the Truth’. Denying whatever truth
is at the time by serving a lie, means you’re also implicitly overriding
the most self-evident, basic nature of the arisen experience—that it
comes first, structurally. Your point of view is structurally second.
So, by engaging in a lie, you’re engaging in a perversion of that order.
That’s why even a little lie is as bad as a big lie—from the point of
view of the mind that wants to practice—because practice means undoing
any perversion to the existential order of the five aggregates.</p>
<p>In the same sense, you cannot engage in a sensual act without sensual
perceptions being implied, and sensual perceptions are sensual
distortions. In other words, you can’t engage in sensuality without
being distorted by sensuality at the same time—without fueling the
already persisting distortion of sensual perception. Likewise, you can’t
engage in a lie without fueling the existential distortion of the arisen
phenomena, the truth—the self-evident arising of whatever’s present.
It’s recognizing that that arisen experience is there on its own, which
means my attitude and my actions concerning it are only because this
thing allows my actions to be a possibility.</p>
<p>For example, if there is no unpleasant feeling manifested, would you
even be able to conceive acting out of an unpleasant feeling, to try to
get rid of it? You wouldn’t. Or, on a less fundamental level, if you
take some experience, for example, you have to go to work. That’s your
arisen situation that persists and has its significance—things you have
to do, reasons why you have to do them. You need to earn money, you need
to provide things, etc. That’s your factual situation. On account of it,
you’ll be acting left and right and deciding. But when you start
engaging in an act of lying, you’re overriding that very order. That
doesn’t mean you can change the order—there are still things arisen on
their own— but you are fully gratuitously giving priority to your point
of view, which in itself, at that time, is based on ignoring what the
real order is. In other words, you start lying about having to go to
work—lying to yourself, not even lying to others—you start saying to
yourself that you don’t need to go to work, because really you don’t
want to go to work. You start lying because the arisen thing is
unbearable, or not necessarily unbearable, but it’s unpleasant and you
don’t want to have to deal with it. That’s why another aspect of an act
of lying is that it’s always rooted in avoiding displeasure—why else
would you be lying? Unless you yourself perceive that, if you don’t
admit the truth, you will avoid that displeasure, the pain of that
truth. But can you really avoid the pain through looking elsewhere? You
can’t. You’re only acting out of it.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> You’re looking elsewhere because it’s
there.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Exactly. But the fact that you engaged in
an act of lying means you do have—or you had it before, and now you’re
maintaining—the belief that you can avoid the arisen pressure of the
truth, the displeasure of the truth, simply by lying. Which then implies
that you can avoid, existentially, arisen phenomena simply by providing
another phenomenon.</p>
<p>The act of lying is fundamentally rooted in a wrong-view—that’s why
it’s fundamentally unwholesome. And it’s the same with any of the
precepts that the Buddha laid out—none of them are universally given
‘Commandments’. All of them are rooted in the principle of greed,
aversion and delusion—which separately are all also principles of some
form of contradicting the arisen nature of experience—which is why it’s
unwholesome to break them. They’re not unwholesome because it’s a
universal morality—they’re unwholesome because they go against how
things have arisen. And that’s how you can know for yourself that
they’re unwholesome—once you understand the nature of things as they
have arisen. Then you have a criterion for what’s skillful and what’s
unskillful—what’s wholesome and what’s unwholesome.</p>
<p>That’s why lying is always wrong—it always goes against the nature of
an arisen thing, whatever that thing is. So, the example we gave: you
don’t want to go and do this particular work. Now you can admit that.
You don’t have to lie to yourself, but that means now you have to take
responsibility for the displeasure you’re feeling. You realize “The work
needs to be done, but I choose not to do it”. Which means all the
reasons that were making you do this work—supporting your family,
earning money, whatever else was the motivation for working—you’re now
responsible for not meeting any of those requirements. And when, down
the line, circumstances remind you of that—your family starts asking for
money, or you get sick and you can’t pay for your treatment and so
on—it’s because you chose not to do this particular work, so you’re
responsible for that. This future misfortune, that came as a result of
not being able to look after yourself, is because you chose not to look
after yourself. There’s nothing wrong with that—you have every right to
choose not to, but that means you must take responsibility for what
comes out of it. But now that means that, by trying to avoid the
responsibility of doing your duty, you’re actually paying the price,
which is even worse. Now you can’t provide for your family, you don’t
have enough money for this or for that, for food… and that’s on you. A
result of your choice to avoid the work. And that’s very unpleasant—you
have to admit that it’s on you— and it can endure for weeks, months—for
as long as you don’t get out of that situation. But it’s still a
responsible thing to do – to admit the weight of your choices.</p>
<p>But it’s way too easy to not admit it, if only you find another
reason for not doing the work, apart from you not wanting to do it. And
that’s the nature of bad faith in existential philosophy, which is like
lying, but not quite, because you’re not necessarily fully self-aware of
the truth, because it’s that very truth you’re trying to cover up from
yourself.</p>
<p>Now, if you say that you couldn’t work because of such and such
reason—because it was raining for example— it’s not “I couldn’t work
because I chose rain to be the reason for my not working,” but it’s “It
was raining, so I couldn’t work,” which means now, when you don’t have
enough money, it’s the weather’s fault. So, you bypass responsibility
for not working at that time, and consequently for all the future
results of not working, because it’s not on you.</p>
<p>That’s why for people it’s always the easiest thing to blame another,
or to blame circumstances—that’s the inauthentic attitude we speak about
often—because, unless you take responsibility on that fundamental level,
you’ll never have a basis for Dhamma to apply, and the fundamental
responsibility is suffering. Again, you don’t want to work because it’s
unpleasant—you don’t want to accept future responsibility for the
consequences of not working, because it’s unpleasant. So fundamentally,
you don’t want to suffer, and you keep avoiding displeasure as the only
means of dealing with suffering that you know. But it doesn’t deal with
it—evading suffering can only be done because suffering has
arisen—that’s the truth. Displeasure is manifested, and you’re liable to
future manifestations of displeasure. That’s the truth that you will
never understand, because all your actions revolve around avoiding that
very truth. And then lying to other people is just an extension of this
very principle.</p>
<p>You can’t undo that principle—when lying to yourself—unless you stop
habitually lying to other people. But ceasing to lie to other people
doesn’t necessarily mean you will automatically undo lying to yourself.
That takes a further effort, but that further effort is only possible on
the basis of the first effort of stopping lying to others. Stop
maintaining, proliferating that wrong order of things through your act
of lying to others, so you reduce it a bit—and then you will be able to
stop lying to yourself as well, and that’s how you can accept
responsibility.</p>
<p>And suffering, as I said, is the fundamental responsibility. See, you
can say “I suffer because he said this,” or “I suffer because I didn’t
get enough,” or “I suffer because I lost my family”, or something like
that. If suffering were truly rooted in those things, you wouldn’t be
able to free yourself from it. But, as the Buddha himself understood and
then taught to others, it fortunately isn’t rooted in those things—it’s
rooted in your resistance to the disagreeable things that come your way,
and these are two different things. But, for as long as your actions
maintain the view that it’s in the things—in what he said, or she said,
or what I had, what I lost—you will never take responsibility for
suffering, for your resistance to the disagreeable experience. And
because of that, you will always remain affected by the disagreeable
experience. So, the only way to stop resisting the disagreeable
experience is to take responsibility for the disagreeable
experience.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> Don’t lie to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Don’t lie to yourself, and consequently
you won’t be lying to others. That’s why an arahant cannot lie. He
became incapable of lying to himself—where the problem is—because he
solved the problem. But in order to not lie to yourself, you have to
stop habitually lying to others.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> What about the common ‘white lies’?</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> They’re not as bad, but you have to be
strict and you’ve got to see—does it partake in the principle of lying,
the principle you’re trying to undo? The principle of perverting the
order of existence, putting the blame where the blame isn’t. And if you
look at the white lies, then you realize they’re still perverting that
order. Why would you tell a white lie? Because you don’t want
discomfort. Why don’t you want discomfort? Because you’re blaming the
discomfort for pain, which means by not wanting discomfort, you’re
avoiding responsibility for resisting the discomfort, and blaming the
discomfort for your suffering, thinking “I’ll just quickly tell a white
lie so I don’t get discomfort, which means I won’t suffer.” No, you
don’t suffer when you don’t resist—it’s not that you don’t suffer when
there is no discomfort. An arahant has discomfort, but he has no
suffering. That’s why white lies are bad.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> And if you could save somebody from
suffering in the future by lying? Like if you were asked “Where is this
person hiding?” when you know these people are looking for this person
to harm or even kill them?</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Well, on a most fundamental level, the
reasons for your actions are always selfish—it cannot be otherwise. You
choose to help others because that’s what’s going to make you happy, or
you choose to help others because that’s how you’re going to avoid
personal discomfort. Others are always secondary.</p>
<p>The only way to go about this is to accept it, and then stop
perverting the order, as we just spoke about. Stop blaming the
circumstances for your suffering and recognize that it’s in your
resisting the circumstances—that’s where suffering is rooted. When
you’re hiding a fugitive or something, and then you lie to others and
say “No, I don’t know where that person is,” then you’re maybe saving
their life—if that’s at stake. But what you’re really acting out of is
your being responsible for choosing to have them in the first place. And
then secondly, not wanting to experience the discomfort of
responsibility because, if you say the truth, they’ll find that person,
and then things might happen to the person. You will be unable to not
blame yourself, and blaming yourself is unpleasant. Really you just want
to prevent circumstances from allowing you to engage in self-blaming,
that’s it. You’re doing it for yourself.</p>
<p>That’s why the Buddha said in the Suttas “If a person who is truthful
to himself and truthful to others is questioned by kings or authorities
thus, ‘Have you seen this?’ he would say, ‘Yes, I’ve seen it’. If he
hasn’t seen it, he would say, ‘No, I haven’t seen it.’ He won’t say one
or the other for no one’s sake—he’ll say the truth.” Why? Because when
you say the truth, if these people that are chasing the fugitive choose
to do certain things to that fugitive, that’s not on you, even if you
say “Yes, he went into that house”. It’s not on you what they choose to
do with him, or why, or to what extent. Your role is not to pervert the
existential order from your point of view because, by doing so, you’re
giving priority to your point of view, which means it’s a slippery
slope.</p>
<p>If you act out of avoiding discomfort, that means you’re going to be
acting out of prolonging pleasure i.e. out of conceit, out of delusion.
And those are the reasons for your own suffering, not the circumstances
you’ve been subjected to. Practically, through trying to avoid
suffering, you end up making yourself more and more liable for
suffering, on that existential level. Hence, no lying, no stealing, no
cheating, no killing. That’s not negotiable because, without that basis,
you cannot overcome the attitude of avoiding responsibility for your own
existence and for your own suffering. You just can’t, even if you want
to.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> It’s a major offence for a monk if he lies
about having attained a superior state, if he lies about his wisdom. Why
is that?</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Well, because of the consequences of it,
the results of the action, that’s why.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> People take what you say as truth.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Well, exactly. It can spread for
generations, and people will then be acting as if it were the truth,
while in reality it isn’t the truth. In other words, as the Buddha
described in some other Suttas, giving to an enlightened being—making an
offering to somebody who is factually awakened, free from suffering—is
the greatest merit. So, if word gets out that so and so is factually
free from suffering—he’s an arahant—then most people will think “I’ll
quickly go and make some merit, because giving to that person is going
to give much more merit than giving to anybody else who isn’t
enlightened.” If that’s the truth, they will actually get all those
results, that great merit, because the person is factually an arahant.
But say somebody spreads a lie that he’s an arahant and nobody knows
it’s a lie, and then people go out of their way, and they don’t give to
others because they want to give to this arahant, but in reality he
isn’t an arahant. So that whole mess was created because somebody lied
that that person is an arahant. As a direct result of that lie, many
people have been misguided and they’ve been acting as if that person’s
an arahant, being sure they’re going to get all this merit, dedicating
all their offerings to that person because he’s an arahant, and then it
turns out he isn’t. So they’ve been deceived directly as a result of
that lie, which means the person who lied is going to be responsible for
that mass deception which, as I said, can last for generations. That’s
why it’s bad.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> You could say that a monk could be
deceiving himself, which then deceives others.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Yes, but that’s different. That’s why
it’s not an offence if a monk does that out of overestimation. That’s
what I meant when I said that lying to others is not quite on the same
level as lying to yourself, because lying to yourself means obscuring
the truth. So simply by obscuring the truth, you’re lying to yourself.
But when you lie to others, it means you’re fully aware of what truth is
being obscured, and then you act completely the opposite way—so it’s an
extra layer.</p>
<p>That’s why the attitude of bad faith—avoiding responsibility—is not
as fully-fledged as lying to another person because, in order to lie,
you need to know what the truth is. You can’t lie if what you think
you’re saying is the truth. But when it comes to yourself, it’s not that
clear-cut, because you’re already refusing to admit what the truth is—to
be fully aware of what the truth is— which means you can’t fully lie to
yourself. Because in order to do so, you’d need to fully admit the truth
to yourself. So lying to yourself is not on the level of actually lying
to yourself, but it’s on the level of repressing, turning away, ignoring
the truth. That’s why avijjā is ignorance. It’s not a metaphysical lack
of information of what the universe is—it’s ignoring what’s right in
front of you. And lying to others comes on the basis of that
principle—it’s just further proliferated.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> And then there’s the sustaining of the
thing that you’re lying about. Someone said, “Lying is the life-blood of
addiction.”</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Sure, but you could say that the
life-blood of lying is avoiding responsibility for your own experience.
Fundamentally, the basis for lying is the attitude of bad faith to
yourself, as in having faith in ignoring, not in what you’re actually
ignoring. That’s what I mean: you pervert the order. The only way you
can ignore something is if it’s there—but you focus on prioritizing the
act of ignoring, not what’s already there. And that’s the most
fundamental attitude towards experience, avijjā. Turning a blind eye.
The only way you can turn a blind eye to something is if that thing is
already there, so the most fundamental attitude of turning a blind eye
is that fundamental wrong-view in regard to the nature of existence—the
fact that “I’m not my own”. The fact that “I’m not in control of
this—this body upon which my whole life depends. I’m subject to ageing,
death, and suffering.” All these things are obvious, but the only reason
people do not resolve them is that they give priority to ignoring them.
And that’s what I mean—you give priority to your point of view on
account of what’s there, in regard to which you exercise your point of
view. And that’s why ignoring ignorance is a vicious circle—avijjā leads
to more avijjā. Ignoring leads to maintenance of the attitude of
ignoring.</p>
<p>What do I need to stop ignoring, to undo the entire avijjā, the whole
saṃsāra? Stop ignoring the arisen feelings, … the arisen intentions. And
that’s why a person who has made that effort and stopped ignoring these
things will become incapable of engaging in ill-will, anger, lying,
cheating—even sensuality, because sensuality in itself is already that
perversion on the fundamental level—finding pleasure in that which is
truly ugly. You ignore that it’s ugly—ignorance of the ugly is the basis
for attraction.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> Or the unattractive.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Yes, ignoring the fundamental
unattractiveness, the fundamental dispassion or absence of passion in
it—ignoring that is how you have maintained passion for it.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> What’s the nature of concealment?</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Well, in many of the Suttas and the
Buddhist writings, you often hear about greed, aversion and delusion:
lobha, dosa, and moha. People can get their head around greed and
aversion, but often delusion is regarded as something that’s not
directly my responsibility, in as much as greed and aversion are.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> Like, “I don’t know what I’ve done
now.”</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Yes, so it’s regarded in a
semi-metaphysical sense—it’s there, but it’s not really something I can
directly experience. But actually it is. Delusion is an attitude of your
mind in as much as greed or lust and aversion are—otherwise they
wouldn’t have always been mentioned like that. So, from that point of
view, delusion is more like an attitude of indolence, laziness.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> A choice to keep things cloudy.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Exactly. Keeping them opaque
intentionally, turning a blind eye, distracting yourself intentionally
with things that are going to take your mind away from yourself. You
realize delusion is a very active thing and, as the Buddha said, that’s
why it’s the most blameworthy. It’s the hardest to undo as well. But the
fact that you can undo it, means it’s not this metaphysical lack of
knowledge—it’s your very attitude, that is even more fundamental than
the attitude of lust and of aversion, which are secondary to it. Lust
requires a basis of delusion, aversion requires a basis of delusion,
delusion requires a basis of delusion. So, you are deluded through and
through, not because you don’t know certain things, but because you
perpetually act out of ignorance, which then maintains you in the
situation of ignorance. And the situation of ignorance is not ignorance
as in not knowing something—it’s you actively ignoring and giving
priority to the ignoring.</p>
<p>It’s choosing to distract yourself, for example by actively making a
choice that will result in certain actions that are not necessarily
lustful or hateful, but are based upon you not wanting to be self-aware.
Entertainment or distraction in general—like when you think “I’m bored
by myself because I’m aware of everything and it’s very unpleasant, so
I’ll just go and chat to some people—not for sensual reasons or because
I like them—just because I want something to do.”</p>
<p>Often needing things to do is rooted in delusion, in distraction,
indolence. You can be very diligent externally—doing all this work—but
the reasons for your doing that work are rooted in your wanting to turn
a blind eye with regard to yourself—you don’t want to be self-aware,
basically.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> You don’t want to see the truth of your
mind.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Well yes, because that will result in
seeing the unpleasant truths of your mind, or simply unpleasant states
of boredom, and so on. So you think “I better find something to do, I
better find an external purpose. It will occupy my mind, so my mind
won’t be aware of itself, because it being aware of itself is too
unpleasant, too threatening.”</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> It’s a way to keep covering up the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Exactly. It’s a way of maintaining
yourself in a state of cover-up.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> To keep the dust moving.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Exactly, otherwise if it settles, you get
to see what’s there, and it’s unpleasant.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> That’s the thing—being self-aware sounds
like a good thing, but it’s the most painful thing. Most people avoid
it.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Yes. That’s why solitude is very
unpleasant to begin with.</p>
<p>As the Buddha himself said many times, you develop the pleasure of
solitude. You won’t get it right away. If done rightly, it’s unpleasant
because you’re going against the grain of all the distraction you got
used to, and that your existence depends upon. But that’s it—when you
stop maintaining all these attitudes that were based upon obscuring the
self-awareness, the self-awareness increases. But it feels like—when the
boredom starts giving rise to dread and anxiety—it feels like you
yourself are drowning. It’s crushing you. But what is actually crushing
you is the assumed level of your own being, the one that you’ve been
proliferating.</p>
<p>The solitude is not actually crushing you. Being alone in your
room—not seeing or talking to anyone—cannot do anything to you. But your
mind can drown in it, because it becomes dependent on a certain degree
of engagement with the world—that is its’ threshold. But that’s not a
static thing, that threshold, which means the more you engage, the more
dependent upon engagement you become. Initially the lesser engagement
might hurt, because you’re used to engaging more. But then you get used
to that, and then it will not be unpleasant.</p>
<p>In the same sense, when you’re a very hectic person who’s been doing
a lot—engaging a lot, working a lot for whatever reasons— if you were
made to sit down and stop engaging on that level, the discrepancy would
be just too much to handle. But if you gradually start doing that and
then start ceasing your engagement, you’ll get used to that new
level—lacking the engagement that you used to have— which means you’re
responsible for the threshold of where your being is. That’s what the
Buddha meant when he said “His consciousness gets established upon
that”—that becomes the norm, what you’re used to, which means anything
less than that is going to fill you with anxiety and dread.</p>
<p>But it’s important to recognize that it’s not a static thing. So
people seek meaning through using engagement with the world—actions,
meaningless or not meaningless work, or whatever else. Practically,
you’re engaging with the world for the purpose of escaping
self-awareness, so you will become dependent on that level of
engagement—anything less than that engagement will bring you back to
your self-awareness. That means then that you have to keep maintaining
the level of your engagement and, once you get used to it, you have to
keep increasing it, if you try to use it to avoid self-awareness. And
most people, to a degree, are using that—that’s why most people are
afraid to be alone. Not afraid of monsters and such, but afraid—in broad
daylight—of being left alone in their room for a whole day without doing
anything, without taking their mind away from themselves. It would
result in them experiencing anxiety and existential dread because human
life, on average, is about avoiding that self-awareness, which ties in
with avoiding responsibility and feeds one another, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> But that self-awareness is the thing that’s
going to make things right, in a way.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> That’s why people are, because of their
own actions, liable to suffering—because of that, not because of someone
else’s fault or some design. It’s because you act in a manner that keeps
making you liable to suffer, keeps you exposed.</p>
<p>If you take responsibility for it, that’s where what I’m saying might
become apparent—that the level of engagement, the level of distraction,
or turning a blind-eye is not a static thing. Which means the way you’ve
been proliferating it, you can also undo it if you stop engaging with
it, or you can certainly put a brake on its growth.</p>
<p>That’s why bhava (being) in the Suttas is not a metaphysical
thing—it’s the level of your dependence on the senses, which is sensual
being, the level of dependence on the sense of the world, duty,
perceptions—the level you depend on them. But then you can start
depending less on those things.</p>
<p>That’s why an arahant has attained cessation of his being—he doesn’t
depend on anything. But he’s still there, it’s not that cessation of
being means destruction. Being means assumption—the assumption of
engagement, of avoiding responsibility, of sensuality—and that’s what
delusion is: ignoring, turning a blind eye, distracting yourself, not
being able to live with yourself. And again you can ask, going back to
that practical level that we always do, “Why is it that I don’t want to
be self-aware? Why is it that I need to distract myself from myself?
Because it’s unpleasant. So why am I then maintaining this whole level
of being for which I’m responsible, the level of how much I depend on
engagement with things? It’s because I don’t want to suffer.”</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> But failing to see that my very engagement
is the root of my suffering.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Exactly. You might wonder “Why do I
suffer, then? It’s because I keep running away from suffering, that’s
why I suffer. Then, if I stop running away from suffering, I at least
have a chance to not suffer.”</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> There’s an example I heard with people in
prison. In prison, punishment may be solitary confinement, and a lot of
people would rather spend their time with other criminals—rapists,
murderers—than be alone.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Well, it’s not incidental that that was
always the worst punishment: solitary confinement for prolonged periods
of time. For an untrained mind, of course.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> Also, some would rather do things that are
bad for them, like taking drugs, than be alone.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> You would rather expose yourself to
genuine existential risks than be alone with yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> Like jumping out of a plane, parachuting,
where you think “I’ll put my life on the line, and I’d rather do all of
these extreme sports just to avoid being alone.”</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Yes, that’s what I mean—it’s not a
stationary thing, which means avoiding boredom needs to be maintained,
because boredom sets in when you get used to the threshold—then you need
to do more.</p>
<p>The same with sensuality, if people use sensuality as a means of
escape, if people get angry as a means of escape, that’s why they keep
getting angrier and angrier as life goes by. They keep getting used to
it and it ceases to work—their means of escape ceases to work, so then
they need to keep running harder.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> The truth is always there and it’s always
pushing.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Always. The fact that you give in to the
attitude of ignoring the truth that’s always there, means you’re running
around in a circle—you don’t ever really run away from it. And everybody
knows that.</p>
<p>If you ask any random person—even someone not familiar with
Buddhism—whether one can satisfy one’s sensual desires, most people will
already know you can’t. You can’t satisfy them, you can only run around
them. The same with anger: the satisfaction of revenge or inflicting
pain back onto somebody—is that really preventing you from experiencing
the pain in the first place? No. You know that, you just can’t help it.
And you can’t help it because you keep ignoring the truth, you keep
ignoring the nature of what’s right in front of you. Hence, ignoring
will automatically, inevitably, result in lust and aversion, in greed
and anger and so on.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean that, if you lock yourself in a room and stop
engaging with the world, you will automatically arrive at the right
understanding either, because it’s a subtle thing. That’s why the
Buddha’s instruction was necessary, or the instruction of somebody who’s
done it themselves the right way. The two possible outcomes for somebody
who doesn’t have that external instruction, if they were to lock
themselves in, are madness—as in the mind would implode because it
wouldn’t know the way out of itself. Or you would develop a degree of
that self-transparency and undo a great level of your being, which means
you’d become more transparent—less subjected to suffering— but you would
have to give in to something. You wouldn’t be able to maintain that
transparency all the way to the core of your being, whereby you’ve
undone every one of the slightest existential discrepancies—or slightest
conceits, as the Buddha called them—and become an arahant. Because if
you did that, you would be self-enlightened. So theoretically it’s
possible, but practically it’s highly unlikely.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t even try. Even a person
who’s not necessarily interested in becoming fully enlightened and
following the Buddha’s instruction to the end, it would do them good if
they’d start withdrawing or keeping in check the level of engagement and
dependence on the world and the senses. Why? Because life will end in
your losing that dependence on sickness, ageing and death. Losing your
senses, the perception of the world, losing the things upon which your
existence depends—or rather the things you used to maintain that level
of being, that helped you to ignore yourself, to be unaware of yourself
and the responsibility that’s inherent in that awareness. If life were
truly to last forever and you would always stay in control of your
senses, then it would be fine—you could do it (indulge in senses). But
it isn’t, and you know that—everybody knows that. Yet you act as if you
will live forever, and the more you’re dependent on the senses that will
disappear and break apart, the more you’ll be affected when that
happens. The less you’re dependent, the less you’ll be affected, and
means the less you’ll suffer.</p>
<p>It’s like the simile the Buddha gave: climbing the tree to eat the
mangos, and eventually somebody’s bound to come up and cut that tree
because they can’t climb it to eat the mangos. Or even if they don’t,
the mangos will age and break down, and the tree will fall. The higher
you were up in that tree the harder you will crash, the more suffering
you will experience. But if you kept yourself in check and stayed maybe
on lower branches, used your reason and self-reflection to not go too
far out, if you controlled yourself from climbing the tree in the first
place, then you wouldn’t crash as hard.</p>
<p>In practical terms, you keep yourself in check with regard to how
much you depend on distraction, on other people, other people’s company,
on gratuitous health, your senses and the ability to access the world
and distract yourself. If you reflected on it, you will keep yourself in
check and then won’t go too far in it. And then when you do get
sick—when your senses do start to fail or when people leave you, or die,
or don’t do what you want them to do—you won’t be as affected, because
you haven’t made yourself as dependent.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> But if you have concealed so much your
whole life…</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> If you’ve concealed so much your whole
life, it’s never too late to start undoing that concealment. So that’s
really the problem there—if you never start undoing your own concealing
of yourself from yourself, concealing the nature of yourself from
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> You never actually faced displeasure.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> Yes. Never admitted it where it is, where
the problem of it is. That’s why people are responsible for being bound
to saṃsāra—it’s not saṃsāra that binds you, you bind yourself to it. And
the Buddha said something to the same effect when he said “It’s because
people take what’s not theirs—what shouldn’t be theirs, what cannot be
theirs, as if it’s theirs and they act out of it that Māra does with
them what he wants”, controls them, subjects them to all these things.
What are the things that cannot be yours and shouldn’t be yours, but you
keep taking as yours, and actually belong to Māra and not to you? It’s
your eyes and your sights, your nose and your smells—your very senses.
The nature of them shows you that they’re not yours. If you ignore this,
you automatically take them as yours.</p>
<p>That’s why just turning a blind eye is enough in itself to result in
the whole mass of suffering. It’s not like “I turn a blind eye, then I
do a second step of taking it as mine, then I do this…” No, turning a
blind eye to the nature of your senses, for example your eyes, your
nose, your body, your life, automatically implies taking this as yours.
Because if you ignore that it’s not yours, you’re automatically implying
that it is yours, that it’s for you, that it’s in your control. And then
you keep acting as if it is in your control, and that’s how you
perpetuate the turning of a blind eye—you keep acting out of it. You’ve
got to stop acting out of it and then stop doing it internally, stop
turning that blind eye, start admitting it, go against the grain.</p>
<p>That’s why everybody can benefit from solitude, to the extent that
they’re able to practice it. But if you don’t practice it to the full
extent, you have to take responsibility for that as well. You might find
yourself already too far in life, whereby you can’t just withdraw from
everything because there’ll be consequences. But that’s no-one else’s
responsibility—you’re responsible for finding yourself in such a
situation. But then people realize that they can’t withdraw themselves
from that situation, so then they feel justified in avoiding
responsibility for it, and that’s completely gratuitous. Yes, you might
not be able—you may have infants and whatever other family members
depending on you, and you can’t just leave, because they’ll die. But
that doesn’t mean you’re justified now in ignoring responsibility for
that situation that you yourself built up. So yes, you can’t ignore the
fact that your choices brought you to these circumstances, where now
other lives depend upon you, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take
responsibility for it—no matter how late the recognition of that
responsibility comes. It’s still better to take it than to ignore it
further – because, who knows, through taking responsibility, some new
ways and options might present themselves that you won’t see as long as
you’re avoiding responsibility. But people don’t take responsibility
because it’s unpleasant.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> When taking responsibility, things become
clearer.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> But because you’re too concerned about
not experiencing discomfort, you basically obscure and limit all these
options that you could have otherwise become aware of. That’s why you
actually get more resilience—become less subjected to suffering—through
recognizing, admitting, taking responsibility. It’s initially more
unpleasant—but in the long run, it’s actually far more pleasant, or far
less unpleasant.</p>
<p>Let’s put it like this: because through taking responsibility, you
see where the problem is, and the problem is in avoiding responsibility.
That’s why you suffer. You suffer not because a disagreeable feeling
touches you—you suffer because you avoid responsibility for the
suffering in regard to the disagreeable feeling. If you start taking
responsibility for that suffering, in regard to the disagreeable
feeling, you stop blaming it for that suffering—which means you stop
resisting, which means you stop suffering. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>Thaniyo:</strong> You stop touching it.</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> You stop getting into the domain that
doesn’t belong to you—that belongs to Māra. If you stop taking it as
yours, that’s it—you cannot be affected by anything then, no matter how
disagreeable.</p>
