In every conceivable experience, there are phenomena that are “farther”
and phenomena that are “closer”. For an undeveloped mind, what is
“closer”, more subtle, less defined and *less changeable* tends to be
regarded as “me” and “mine”, given that it’s not even seen and is taken
for granted, and attention rests on what is “over there” in the form of
sense objects and the world. The usual way of practicing *satipaṭṭhāna*
which involves keeping one’s attention on bodily sensations and
*objects* of various kinds, only serves to maintain this lack of
development of the mind, and all the *seemingly* beneficial results it
may provide will still be obtained within the framework that puts “me”
at the center of experience, and thus are not truly beneficial in the
quest for the freedom from suffering.[^1]

Instead, the goal of right recollection (*sati*) is to establish and
sustain the memory of a more accurate picture, that does not *overlook*
that which is “closer”, and takes into account its true nature of being
liable to change and deterioration, just like everything that is
“further away” from the point of view.

Seeing a “a body\[1\] within the body\[2\]”, as the *satipaṭṭhāna*
refrain goes, and which has been translated in a myriad ways that *miss
the* ***central*** *point*, means that you see your experience as a
whole at any time, the entire six-sense field, as a body\[2\] that is
less fundamental, secondary to body\[1\]. “Within” means just that:
body\[1\] is at the “center” of body\[2\], because it’s more primordial.

Body\[1\] can be anything that is a simultaneous foundation or necessary
basis for body\[2\], which is whatever aspect of the body you see, use,
and are attached to, as well as anything in the world you perceive. Most
importantly, this body\[2\] is what your sense of self can call “me” and
“mine”. Body\[1\] is the material things that determine your body\[2\],
such as your organs, the Four Great Elements, your breathing, or
material “stuff” that is no more special than that which makes up a
corpse (the practices mentioned under Body Contemplation in MN 10).

An analogy to illustrate the relationship between these “two bodies” can
be made by borrowing from science for a moment. At the center of each
galaxy, there is a black hole which the other celestial bodies orbit
around, owing to the black hole’s immense gravitational pull. But this
black hole cannot be *seen* or measured directly. Rather, the presence
of the black hole is *implied* in the movement of the surrounding stars
and planets. But, if unaware of the existence of black holes or how they
work, one will have to *assume* that there is some mysterious force
orchestrating all that movement. Similarly, whenever you don’t
indirectly *know* the presence of the true “center” of experience—of
body\[1\], which equally cannot be perceived directly because that would
put it within body\[2\]—then you are *already assuming* your sense of
self to be that center, or the orchestrator of the movements, and this
is the perpetual state of whoever lacks the Right View. For as long as
you don’t discern body\[1\] *within* body\[2\], which is what makes you
a *sotāpanna*, your contemplation that “this is impermanent” or “this is
not mine” is, to extend the analogy, just another star that you regard
as orbiting around **you**.

In the case of feeling, there’s always a feeling in your experience
that’s more “central” than all the others, which are comparatively
fleeting. An example of this is when you’ve having a good day, and all
the particular things you encounter, some of which may be quite
unpleasant, don’t disturb you as much. Conversely, when that general
feeling is unpleasant, even the things that would usually give you joy
fail to do so.

If you see that at the core of all those other more particular feelings,
determining them, lies that more primary feeling, you don’t then need to
go and “manually” remove the sense of ownership and tell yourself that
this or that feeling is not yours. None of it will be yours because
you’re no longer the “center” whether you like it or not, but rather
that “core” feeling is (and always was), since it is because of it that
all the other particular feelings either pleased you or bothered you,
regardless of your desire to always be pleased.

With “a mind within the mind”, it’s the same. A more primordial state of
mind always *simultaneously* underlies all the more particular moods
that may arise, and so you must discern that at the “core” of all the
other moods and emotions that you’re experiencing. Particularly relevant
in this case is, as the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta describes, recognizing a mind
that is either affected with or free from lust, aversion, and delusion.
This is how you would begin to see what actually determines something as
unwholesome, which is when that “core” has lust, aversion and delusion
in it and you’re taking it for granted and acting out of it. Without
seeing that “center” as that which determines your more particular
experiences and actions, you would fall into the common idea that it’s
the way you move, talk and the specific thoughts you’re having which
serve as the criteria for what is unwholesome. You could then become
perfectly restrained, gentle and polite in your outward expression, even
never really have lustful or hateful thoughts, but you would fail to see
that at the “center” of *all that* is a state of mind affected with
craving whose sway you are still under.

With *dhammas* it’s more varied, but to give an example, you would see
the sense bases as the “center” and everything else as surrounding that.
Only by not seeing that that’s the actual center that is just being
“hit” by sense objects, and thus automatically *being* the center
oneself, can there be lust or aversion towards sense experiences. And
that’s also how the hindrances work: they hinder you because you don’t
even recognize their “center”, thus everything you do is blindly going
with the grain of those hindrances, even the Dhamma practice. It’s not
because of the center itself or what “surrounds” that center, which is
why it’s futile to try to stop one’s thinking, concentrate on something
else, etc., intentionally arouse feelings of joy, etc.[^2]

When that simultaneous *relationship* is seen,[^3] whether in terms of
the body, feelings, mind or phenomena, it becomes inconceivable to
exercise a sense of ownership over *both* thing\[1\] and thing\[2\], the
sum of which nothing can possibly be outside of. You now see that you
cannot be that center even if you wanted to, and body\[1\], which is
clearly not yours, becomes the “center” instead. Same principle applies
to the other *satipaṭṭhānas*. They render ownership redundant and
inconceivable.

This “ownership becoming inconceivable” point cannot be emphasized
enough, given that it’s possible for people to think that, because they
can now apparently overcome the sense of self by “applying” some
practice, they therefore have right mindfulness or became *sotāpannas*.
This is not it. It is entirely out of the question for the assumption of
self and its associated suffering to ever arise again if “body within
the body”, etc., has been understood—even if one doesn’t do any
meditation for the rest of one’s life[^4]. This is precisely the reason
that the Buddha had to constantly urge Noble disciples not to become
complacent, which would be unimaginable for one whose idea of sati
hinges on habits and practices (*sīlabbataparāmāsa*), without which the
progress they made collapses. The capacity to see “a body within the
body” makes such things lose all importance.

Being able to see a body within the body, a feeling within feelings, a
mind within the mind, and a phenomenon within phenomena is also what
puts an end to the four fundamental assumptions in regard to the
aggregates, one of which a *puthujjana* will inevitably have at any
given time.

On the other hand, the instructed Noble disciple, the stream-enterer or
higher, is “well-instructed” and “Noble” because they’ve seen that what
is “within” form\[2\] cannot be anything but form\[1\], and that *even*
if they chose to embrace either of them and call it “mine and mine
alone”, it would not actually be *assumed* (*upādāna*) as such on the
level that matters, because, even in a mundane sense, assuming things is
made possible only by the lack of knowledge. Once you *know*, you cannot
fool yourself again even if you try.

The well-known “in the seen just the seen”[^5] employs the same concept
of something being “inside” of something else. One must learn to see
that that inner “center”, where the notion of self gets established, is
actually nothing more than a bundle of subtler phenomena that pertain
to—and thus **depend** on and could not have arisen without[^6]—what is
seen. And, in turn, the seen would not be intelligible without these
subtler phenomena that are “further back”. These phenomena are simply
less palpable, less defined thoughts, intentions, feelings, notions,
memories, views, ideas, expectations, etc., which *arise as such*. If
you actually discern that that more ambiguous “center” is also a
manifest *thing(s)*, just subtler and on a different plane than the
sense objects are, it becomes unthinkable to be the owner of the seen,
despite the fact that there are very much still these less-palpable
background things you ***used to*** assume as “mine” associated with the
sights, that arise as “closer” than the sights themselves.

Learn how to see these background things as the center that your sights
“orbit” around instead of trying to descend onto the “bare perceptions”
of “raw sense data”, which is, to return to the previous analogy, akin
to focusing your efforts on the things orbiting the black hole rather
than on your ignorance of it.

Lastly, what allows one to truly see those two simultaneous planes and
thus get the Right View, be it in terms of the four *satipaṭṭhānas* or
“the seen within the seen”, is to have been practicing the Gradual
Training—living virtuously, withdrawn from sensuality and not delighting
in the company of others—for a long time. Unrestrained actions (“me
here” seeking the pleasant objects “yonder”) and unnecessary company
(“me here” and other people “yonder”) automatically abolish right
perspective and maintain the sense of self: the notion of ***me*** being
the center, pressured to act towards the things “around me”. It is
because people continue reinforcing the sense of self through such
actions that they then feel the need to *abolish* the “center”
altogether when it’s time to practice, and are thus unable to see the
Middle Way, devoting themselves to the hopeless battle of denial
instead, which can only provide trivial, temporary rewards.

Note: This way of explaining “body within body” is an equivalent
alternative to the way used in my essay “[The Meaning of Yoniso
Manasikāra](https://bbballs.github.io/hillside_hermitage_archive/essays/2023-06-22-essay-Anigha-The_Meaning_of_Yoniso_Manasikara.html)”
and generally in the Hillside Hermitage Dhamma Talks. I opted for this
different way of describing the “within” aspect this time around given
that it corresponds to the Pāli more literally. However, there is
absolutely no relevant difference in the meaning conveyed, and in both
paradigms what is actually being pointed at is the simultaneous
principle that underlies one’s whole experience and undermines one’s
ownership of it, discerning which the view of self would not be able to
find room where there isn’t any.

</div>

[^1]: Contrary to popular belief, *anattā* is not about there being no
    center to the experience and no individuality, in which case stark
    differences in character between two *Arahants* would be
    inexplicable. It’s about the fact that the “center” is not yours,
    not in your control.

[^2]: See relevant talk: [Seeing Through The Hindrances Instead of
    Denying Them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDdMyOTylH0)

[^3]: Relationship which will only be obscured by focusing on an object.
    This would only serve to sustain the sense of **me** being at the
    core of the experience and looking at it.

[^4]: This is a good litmus test for the Right View and Right
    Recollection: if you put aside ***everything*** you’ve learned about
    the Dhamma and all the information, habits, and practices you’ve
    acquired, and abandon all efforts, including your “formal
    meditation”, is there room to doubt that your inability to suffer
    and recognition of the nature of things will remain untouched? If
    yes, then whatever it is, it’s still not the Noble *sati* that was
    developed, and it’s important to remind oneself of that as often as
    possible.

[^5]: This has nothing to do with the celebrated and fallacious idea of
    “bare perceptions”, often linked with the practice of “noting” and
    similar, which is underlain by the wrong view that liberation is
    when parts of the aggregates have been magically deleted, and there
    are only the “pure sensations” and “pure present moment” left, as if
    everything else ― namely thoughts, intentions, plans, preferences,
    concepts, ideas ― was ever in itself an issue. Ironically, it is
    also that “everything else” that distinguishes us from animals, and
    gives us the ability to develop wisdom in the first place.

[^6]: All that’s explained in this essay is synonymous with seeing
    *paṭiccasamuppāda*, the principle of simultaneous dependence. It’s
    no coincidence that acquiring *sammāsati* is synonymous with seeing
    the Dhamma.
