title: Sīla is Samādhi
---

What exactly is the connection between *sīla* and *samādhi*? Is it that
virtue *aids* or *facilitates* the development of mental composure[^1],
in the way that a suitable diet *contributes* to an athlete’s top
physical performance—a secondary factor that allows for better results
with greater ease, or that prevents setbacks down the line? This is what
the relationship is often imagined to be, especially given how modern
notions of *samādhi* go together with arbitrary practices that have no
direct connection to the abstinence from unwholesome acts, except
perhaps in that one cannot move, speak, or (supposedly) think *at
all* while one is engaging in them. Because of this, the link between
*sīla* and *samādhi*  is often rather contrived and tenuous, and is not
a central theme within the overall picture.

</div>

Being *accomplished* in virtue provides one with a form of composure
that one can easily fail to recognize due to one’s expectations of what
*samādhi* is about, and thus even a person who has put in the work into
their virtue correctly can end up misapplying their efforts in various
directions that do not take that same virtue as foundation, which is
what would have not only resulted in greater composure, but also in a
comparatively straightforward and seamless manner.[^2] Conversely, one
not yet sufficiently accomplished in virtue can be tempted to put the
cart before the horse, and thereby end up reaping either frustration, or
a sort of *samādhi* that somehow does not seem to be contributing to
true knowledge-&-vision, thereby destroying the first five fetters  and
making them *incapable* of experiencing lust for sensual pleasures and
ill-will. Because that is what *sammāsamādhi* would *have to* result in,
especially if the person already has plenty of familiarity with the
Dhamma and the Four Noble Truths, *and* they’ve been practicing right
composure for years.[^3]

That other sort of *samādhi* would instead provide a person with
ecstatic experiences that simply take them away from their problems for
a while… until they come back, while also encouraging them to keep the
virtue chiefly <u>***in order to***</u> once again experience the
meditative ecstasy they can’t have enough of, not because they are
*truly* disenchanted with sensuality, which is actually a
*prerequisite* for the first jhāna.[^4]

</div>

Now, I should clarify what the expression “aggregate of/accomplishment
in virtue” means[^5], since it is obviously not being claimed that mere
adherence to a set of rules, be it 5, 10, or 500, is enough to give rise
to *samādhi. Sīla* or virtue should not be taken—at least by one who
aspires to mental purification—as the undertaking of the precepts alone,
but rather, using the common phrase of the Suttas, as the avoidance of
the *slightest fault*[^6], i.e., any action by body and speech that is
motivated by lust, aversion, or distraction. This means that one must
start recognizing these unwholesome things *in one’s own mind*, rather
than determining what is suitable and unsuitable through the details of
*what* one did, where, how, at what time, to whom, or for what external
reason[^7], or because it simply “feels” nice, wholesome or kind on the
surface[^8]. This proper virtue also involves not being content with
simply adhering to the external form and standards set by a specific
tradition or group.

By gradually learning, first and foremost, to *recognize* one’s state of
mind[^9] as it is, and then taking *that* as the criterion for the
character of all of one’s actions, big or small as they may be, one is
already working towards the indispensable foundation of all proper
*samādhi*—picking up the “hints” of the mind (*cittassa nimitta*)[^10].
The discernment of those “hints” is what enables one to abandon
defilements where they *actually are* starting with one’s actions, as
opposed to dealing with secondary factors or taking on practices and
habits one *assumes* to be always wholesome in themselves:

</div>

This Sutta points out how a person would not realize that using the four
*satipaṭṭhānas* is not automatically skilful in and of itself, just like
any given dish is not guaranteed to please the king, no matter how good
the cook or other people think it is, or even how much the king took
from it yesterday. The four *satipaṭṭhānas* are skilful **only** if they
are being used *for the sake of abandoning the blemishes*. And for that,
one needs to ***see*** “blemish as blemish” clearly *first*, i.e. see
the hints of the defilements in one’s mind, which practically goes
hand-in-hand with stream-entry.[^12]

And this ability  to “aim” the four *satipaṭṭhānas* at the right place
and thereby achieve all these beneficial results, including *samādhi*,
is nothing other than a more refined instance of the same discernment
that needs to accompany one’s virtue: one needs stop judging good and
bad behavior by the external properties of an action, e.g. by the tone
of one’s speech and the choice of words, or the fact that all Buddhists
or those in one’s tradition agree that doing or saying this or that is
good, and instead *see* whether there is *internal* greed, aversion, or
delusion *behind* those superficially “good” actions in one’s mind
here-&-now. In this way, it becomes obvious how *samādhi* is the *same
skill*, just practiced on a much subtler level.

So, if a person fails to grasp the hints of their mind in the coarse
context of bodily and verbal actions to the point where the *slightest
fault* in any environment circumstance, anywhere in the world can be
avoided with certainty, independent of what others or a spiritual
tradition may regard as a fault, how will they possibly grasp those
hints when it comes to the more refined level of thoughts, in order to
*know* the mental blemishes properly and tackle them where they are to
be found, instead of misusing the four *satipaṭṭhānas* to address
secondary mental phenomena that they <u>*take to be* blemishes</u>?[^13]

It’s like saying “I can’t reliably land an arrow on the *tree
trunk,* but I can definitely shoot down the mangoes.”

Not even seeing the value of  this higher virtue, it is easy to end up
believing that stopping one’s thinking is what the first *jhāna* is
about. It is the same as believing that it’s necessary to lock oneself
up in a cell for the rest of one’s life and never see another human to
never commit unsuitable acts by body and speech again. Failing to see
what the root of the problem is, one takes the easy route, trying to
throw *everything* away, instead of going through the hard work of
refining one’s criteria of what really needs to be discarded. This is a
task which will initially seem much less “palpable”, and instead feel
vague, uncertain, and comparatively unsatisfying, especially because
there is no obvious “prize” waiting anywhere in the vicinity, unlike
with a meditation technique, which may promise one such things within
days.

Having established these points, what the “aggregate of virtue”
mentioned above is should be much clearer, as well as how it would
seamlessly *become* mental composure when further refined and fortified.
The meaning of the simile of the king defeating his enemies in the first
Sutta quoted, DN 2, can be seen in light of this. By seeing the hints of
your own mind, recognizing those “enemies” *internally* where they truly
are, you gain complete certainty that nothing that comes from any
direction whatsoever (circumstances, people, accidents, mistakes) can
*force you* to commit a fault, a blemish to your virtue. Having defiled
motivations in  your mind, overlooking them, and acting out of them is
what constitutes a fault.[^14] This is how you become your own “enemy”.

The word “aggregate” *(khandha)* also adds an important nuance. When the
Suttas talk about “aggregate of *sīla/samādhi/paññā*” this denotes a
level of acquisition of that quality which no longer requires *active
effort* or additions to it, but is now just “sitting there” like a heap
or pile, the literal meaning of *khandha*. In the context of virtue, it
means that one no longer needs to stop and interrogate oneself before
every action for 10 minutes like in the beginning,[^15] but rather every
suitable and unsuitable intention within one’s mind is clear beyond
doubt just by “looking” at it. One has sufficiently learned how to *pick
up the hints* of the mind’s previously unnoticed motivations.
Consequently, rather than needing effort to *keep* one’s virtue, effort
is now required to *break it.* Using the previous simile, the king would
now have to *intentionally* be careless and allow his enemies an opening
to strike back and successfully defeat him. It’s just too obvious when
they’re planning to strike back.

And this recognition, as the Sutta goes on to say, is what gives rise to
a blameless joy. It’s “blameless” because it’s not based on something
that you *acquired* and will sooner or later be ripped away from
you,[^16] but on something you would have to, *with full
deliberation,* *choose* to cast aside. Literally, not even death itself
can take that aggregate of virtue away, and much less can the lack of an
ideal retreat environment do so.

At this point it should be noted that this *aggregate* of higher virtue
(not just a *pile* of mere precepts and observances),  paired with the
instructions of one who sees the Dhamma (*parato ghosa*), should already
be enough of a basis for a person to develop the Right View. In fact, in
the Suttas, the phrase “one who has fulfilled virtue” is often one of
the epithets of a *sotāpanna*.

<div lang="en">

>
> — AN 3.86[^17]

</div>

Notice that it is said that such a person might still break minor rules
at times (even the Arahant mentioned later in the Sutta could), but that
is not what the *fulfilment* of virtue is. It’s the fact that they
cannot overlook the hints of the unwholesome motivations in their own
mind[^18], and *because of that*, they do not transgress by acting out
of *those* motivations, which is what would compromise the essential
training.[^19]

Therefore, given that composure is a refinement of the same principle as
virtue, it is unlikely (but not impossible) that a person would be able
to see their own mind to the point necessary to attain the *jhānas*
taught by the Buddha and not become a *sotāpanna* first, because they
would’ve already reached the necessary development long before that. The
most likely cause of not becoming one is that they haven’t heard the
Dhamma sufficiently, or at all, but this is hardly possible today if
they put in that much work into purifying their mind correctly, given
that other spiritual traditions tend not to stress the abandonment of
sensuality to the necessary degree.

In light of this—while an unenlightened person should be encouraged to
put in the work towards *understanding* the practice of composure, since
understanding it correctly to the necessary degree would already
constitute seeing the Fourth Noble Truth and thus
stream-entry[^20]—they’d be better off not expecting it to culminate in
an actual *jhāna* anytime soon, but rather regarding those efforts as
one possible avenue to approach the Dhamma, and as a good way to learn
how to grasp the hints of the mind and thus of wholesome and
unwholesome, which is the condition for stream-entry.

Thus, again, the work would then be in attempting to *understand* what
Right Composure is, being careful not to assume they already know what
it is, that they understand the *Noble* Eightfold Path. And certainly,
taking any “special meditation experiences” they may’ve had in the past,
which somehow don’t seem to have contributed to abandonment of
sensuality and ill-will, with a pinch of salt.

If this is kept in mind, it is possible for a person still without the
Right View, but who has developed their virtue to as high of a degree as
possible, to derive some benefit from often pursuing the following type
of reflections as a “meditation” practice in the proper sense.[^21]

Virtue (which includes sense restraint, moderation in eating, and
general not acting out of unwholesome states[^22]) needs to have been
developed and understood to a point where you can at least notice  some
degree of that “blameless joy”, which comes from discerning and
correctly restraining the degree of unwholesome intentions that you’ve
learned to pick up on so far, without intentionally *trying* to give
rise to that joy with the help of secondary mental drills, because that
would be done *at the expense* of the abandoning of craving.

Having gone to a solitary place, free from the presence of others and
from distractions, thoughts in the form of desires, annoyances,
boredom/laziness, anxieties and doubts about various issues will
inevitably come to the foreground of attention, and here you can—with
the *memory* of your virtue[^23] as the central foundation—start trying
to see how a different route than the usual two extremes that one is
used to (indulgence and denial) could in fact be taken towards those
mental states.[^24]

So, *recalling* (sati) the past efforts to develop virtue, are there
some valuable insights that could be carried over and used to not let
the mind get blemished on account of these assailing thoughts which
clearly came on their own, *without* wanting to put your hand into what
is not yours by trying to get rid of them?

Remember some occasion in the recent past where you were faced with a
prospect to break your virtue. What did you do? Did you find a way to
stop that annoying fly from doing what it does, or did you simply
resolve that you *would not kill it*? Do you smash every bottle of
alcohol you come across, or do you simply *not* *drink* even if you’re
asked to? Did you prevent all sexually appealing people from existing,
or did you simply *restrain* the urge to pursue them? And, most
importantly, why is it that you now don’t feel a threat to your virtue
whenever these temptations and annoyances inevitably knock at your door,
much unlike when your virtue was still weak?[^25]

It will be evident that it’s because now you’re *confident* that you
will ***not*** open that door, no matter how hard or how long it gets
knocked on. And *that alone* is what gives rise to the *factual* safety
you would be able to recognize, and precisely because it doesn’t depend
on circumstances anymore does it feel like safety—it cannot be
compromised by anyone but yourself.

So, it is more than reasonable to conclude that an even deeper sense of
safety could be achieved *while* these thoughts are now knocking at the
*mental* door[^26] when you’re in seclusion, if you found a way to be
confident that you will *not* open it no matter how much of a racket
those thoughts make “outside” of it.

To accomplish this, it will be necessary to be clear on what exactly
constitutes “opening the door”, and what constitutes “noise outside”
because given the subtlety of the distinction, one is guaranteed to
confuse the former with the latter and vice versa in the beginning. *The
“hints” won’t be obvious.*

Let’s take arguably the most relevant instance of a “door knocker”,
which is a thought of a beautiful object:

<div lang="en">

> “They are not sensuality, the pretty things **in the world**:   
> a person’s sensuality is **volitional lust (saṅkapparāga)**;   
> the pretty things remain just as they are in the world,   
> but the wise remove the desire for them.”
>
> — AN 6.63

</div>

But what does the Buddha mean by “the world”? Does he mean “out there in
the city”?

<div lang="en">

> Venerable sir, it is said, ‘the world, the world.’ In what way,
> venerable sir, might there be the world or the description of the
> world?”
>
> “Where there is the eye, Samiddhi, where there are forms,
> eye-consciousness, things to be cognized by eye-consciousness, there
> the world exists or the description of the world.
>
> “Where there is the ear … the mind, where there are mental phenomena,
> mind-consciousness, things to be cognized by mind-consciousness, there
> the world exists or the description of the world.
>
> — SN 35.68

</div>

So then, it is *volitional lust* **towards** that which manifests within
the world (the 6 sense bases) that constitutes sensuality. Anything less
than this is just a “pretty thing in the world”. But how would one pick
up the “hint” of that *volitional lust*? Is it by whether the perception
of the object is present *at all*? Would it be instead by the intensity
of emotional pressure, the feeling that accompanies the thought? Would
it be by the *possibilities*/intentions *(cetanā)* implied in it?[^27]

Luckily, several Suttas give us the answer in different formulations but
with the same meaning. Two examples should suffice:

<div lang="en">

> At Sāvatthī. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Rādha said to the
> Blessed One: “Venerable sir, it said, ‘Māra, Māra’. What now,
> venerable sir, is Māra?”
>
> “Form, Rādha, is  Māra. **Feeling** … **Perception** …
> **Intentions** … Consciousness is Māra…
>
> — SN 23.12

</div>

<div lang="en">

> “The eye is mine, ascetic, forms are mine,  **the base where
> eye-pressure is cognized**[^28] **is mine. Where can you go, ascetic,
> to escape from me?**
>
> The ear is mine, ascetic, sounds are mine … The nose is mine, ascetic,

> ascetic, mental phenomena are mine, **the base where mind-pressure is
> cognized is mine. Where can you go, ascetic, to escape from me?**”
>
> — SN 4.19

</div>

What these passages imply is that no amount of pressure, feeling or
*suggested* actions that a sight, sound, smell, taste, touch or thought
brings with it can possibly be what lust is *in and of itself*, because
if that were the case, there would be no escape from lust, no escape
from Māra. Lust would *have to* arise without fail if certain feelings
were to arise.[^29] But luckily, this is not the case, and thus
liberation is possible to begin with.

Rather, as the verse from AN 6.63  says, it is one’s ***volitional
lust***, one’s *deliberate choice to accept* the presented possibilities
to try to “release” the mental pressure that is the problem. Not the
pressure, perceptions, feeling or the *suggestions* to act in and of
themselves, no matter how they arise—these are just the “racket outside
the door”, the door that one can learn how to keep closed and remain
safely behind, at ease. Besides:

<div lang="en">

> “Then, engaging further in inward exploration, he explores thus: ‘When
> this craving arises, where does it arise? When it settles down, upon
> what does it settle?’
>
> “As he explores, he understands thus: ’Whatever in the world has a
> pleasant and agreeable nature: it is here that this craving arises
> when it arises; it is here that it settles when it settles down. ’And
> what in the world has a pleasant and agreeable nature? **The eye** has
> a pleasant and agreeable nature in the world: **it is here** that this
> craving arises when it arises; it is here that it settles when it
> settles down. So too **the ear,  the nose, the tongue, the body, and
> the mind** have a pleasant and agreeable nature: **it is here** that
> this craving arises when it arises; it is here that it settles when it
> settles down.
>
> — AN 12.66

</div>

Thus, it’d be wrong to think  that abandonment and replacement of *sense
objects,* including thoughts that arose on their own, is abandonment of
craving.[^30]

Now, continuing from where we left off, you are in seclusion now, away
from people and distractions, plus you keep your virtue and sense
restraint  well and see the danger in the slightest fault, so you don’t
*do* anything lustful with your body and speech, and yet evidently the
mind is still not free from lust. This is where “mental action” is
taking place, the choice to “open the door” for the bandits waiting
outside, which is still being overlooked.

The reason why the door is still “open” is because the mind
*(citta)* still *values* the possibility of experiencing the pleasure
that is being offered by the mind *(mano)*[^31]. Thus, you are not
*certain* in your internal renunciation of that *offered* pleasure,
unlike in the domains of body and speech. This means that, even though
you have developed restraint and are not specifically *planning* to
pursue the pleasure through actions, the *citta* still holds, to some
vague degree, that it would be “nice” to experience with the body this
offer that *mano* is presenting. And that value of “nice” is where the
unwholesome is, *not* in what is being presented. This is what the
Suttas mean by “welcoming, delighting in, entertaining agreeable
objects”. The only proper solution to this is to abandon that *value*,
that notion of “nice to get this”, right where it is, without trying to
prevent the *offer* and its pressuring feeling from being there—that
feeling is *utterly inseparable from that perception*, as said above.
Both the feeling and perception clearly have come, and will likely come
again in the future, as a “bait” placed by Māra, and their presence is
thus not in your ultimate control.

That “value” can be abandoned not by *choosing* to stop valuing the
pleasure directly, but by clarifying and reflecting on the drawbacks of
*accepting* the bait that is being presented to you.[^32]
One does not need supramundane discernment to realize that *stepping
into a trap* is never in one’s best interests, no matter how good the
bait in it is. Even if once you’re inside, the hunter is nice enough to
give you a few more treats, the fact is that *now you’re in his
control*, so if he ever feels like doing something bad to you, you have
no way to stop it. And deep down you know, he *will* do so ultimately,
at the latest when your sense bases, which you have been doubling down
in regarding as yours and as dear by valuing their pleasures, begin to
break apart.[^33]

It must be emphasized that the purpose of this contemplation of danger
is not to get rid of the arisen *thought*, but to address one’s
inability to remain *internally* unmoved by its alluring nature. It is
because you are *emotionally* *bothered* by that “itch” that you relish
the prospect of getting it “scratched’. But in and of itself, no amount
of itch *requires* scratching. One’s mind not being free from lust,
infected with distorted notions, is what *assumes* that scratching is
“necessary”. Also, notice how in the above Sutta, the man simply
*refrains* from doing what would cause the lamp to burn longer than it
should on its own. He doesn’t *manually* try to get the oil out or put
out the fire. This is the only way to abandon an unwholesome state
without generating another.

If you were to maintain this context of “danger” on the *right
level* long enough, where that “scratch” is being *desired* instead of
where the “itch”[^35] is, you would at some point realize that the *same
itch* is no longer unpleasant[^36] because you no longer *feel a
need* to scratch it, not because you got rid of it by force. Rather than
being a threat, the “itch”, which is not bothering you at all anymore,
will now serve to remind you of your state of safety from the *need* to
scratch, as if you’re now free from debt, illness, imprisonment, slavery
or managed to cross a desert. That sense of safety is a wholesome joy
(and notice that you haven’t stopped thinking). Because, how can you say
“I am safe” unless you’re safe *from something?* What’s more, how can
that safety and the joy arising from it become the central theme of your
experience, your *abiding* as said in the Suttas, unless that which was
a threat before is still being equally *recognized*? Forgetting about
the threat would mean forgetting about the safety, even in mundane
terms. This is why one who succeeds in this practice fully and
disengages  from sensuality correctly has “blindfolded” Māra:

<div lang="en">

> “And where is it that Māra and his following cannot go? Here, having
> fully disengaged from sensuality, fully disengaged from unwholesome
> states, a bhikkhu dwells having entered the first jhāna, which is
> accompanied by thinking and pondering, with joy and pleasure born of
> disengagement. This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Māra[^37], to
> have become invisible to the Evil One by depriving Māra’s eye of its
> opportunity.”
>
> — MN 25

</div>

It is precisely because you **don’t** prevent Māra from setting up his
bait (which is none other than the pressure of the six sense bases) that
he is confused and at a loss. Before this point, it had always been a
*guaranteed* catch every time he set up the trap, given that even when
you tried to avoid it before, you went overboard and attempted to *get
rid* of the trap, by trying to get rid of the mental pressure—stop
thinking, concentrate twice as hard hard on your abdomen or tip of your
nose, etc.[^38] Therefore, you always *touched* the trap either to eat
the bait or to throw it away, and that’s all the hunter needed to get
you. But now, you are learning to not *take* the bait, nor try to
*remove* it either. This is, contrary to one’s distorted gut-feeling, is
the only way to stay safe:

<div lang="en">

> “How, dear sir, did you cross the flood?”  
>   
> “By not halting, friend, and by not struggling I crossed the flood.”  
>   
> “But how is it, dear sir, that by not halting and by not straining you
> crossed the flood?”  
>   
> “When I halted, friend, then I sank; but when I struggled, then I got
> swept away. It is in this way, friend, that by not halting and by not
> struggling I crossed the flood.”
>
> — SN 1.1

</div>

That same reflection and attitude is to be applied to any other
hindrance, irrespective of its peculiarities. This is because they all
share the same nature of that “itch” or pressure, that “trap” which one
will *automatically* fall for if unclear about where the line is and how
to not cross it. Lack of clarity and perspective means *already* being
trapped within a hindrance. Displeasure and annoyance are the second
kind of “trap”, which one must learn to “see through” and contemplate
 so as to see that the problem is one’s subtle need to *act out of it*,
which is what ill-will is. Same for the other 3 hindrances. All of them
are actually different symptoms of the *same thing*.[^39]

For this reason, if one simply learns to see “mental pressure” or
“impulses” in the most general sense, even without classifying it into a
particular hindrance, and learns to *neither act* out of that impulse
*nor* prevent it from being where it is (a subtler way of acting out of
it), then the entire *domain* of unwholesome, the domain of *kamma* and
thus all suffering and adversity, can be surmounted one day. And this
is the same principle that virtue is based upon—one does not accept the
impulse to act out, nor does one prevent it from arising.

This “enduring” of mental pressure (*with the right perspective*, not
just “mindless bearing”) that is required to abandon the five hindrances
is the common thread to *jhāna* and Nibbāna, which would have to
culminate in the latter eventually when paired with correct views and
instructions. This is how Right Composure *factually* inclines the mind
towards Nibbāna.[^40] Nibbāna is not about discovering a hidden
experiential truth through an esoteric revelation or experience, but
about perfect immovability, and thus *peace*, in the face of anything
that can arise in one’s experience. And with this, lust, aversion and
delusion, and the fetters of self-view, conceit and ignorance are
destroyed, because their *raison d’être* is gone—the constant, futile
attempt to outrrun the pressure of the senses.

It should now be evident that abandoning these subtle mental attitudes
and escaping Māra’s traps in the right way would never be possible if a
person is still falling for the obvious traps with their body and
speech. No amount of effort in meditation would be able to make up for
the fact that their *actions* are still infected with lust, aversion,
and distraction.

Māra doesn’t care how well you can perform a mechanical mental exercise
and how much pleasure it provides you with. All that matters to him is,
you still *could* bite the hook. For as long as that’s the case, he’s
got you already. This is why *actions* by body, speech and mind are what
enables the five hindrances, and thus ignorance,  to thrive, and not
one’s lack of skill in repetitive techniques, “energy blockages” in
one’s body or mind, lack of merit from past lives, or anything else that
distracts one away from starting to restrain those actions.

<div lang="en">

>
> — AN 10.61

</div>

To sum up, the right kind of composure is in having the mental strength
to not take Māra’s bait without needing to shun it either, and
developing the right kind of unwavering virtue is the first,
indispensable step in that same direction.

[^1]: Translating “*samādhi*” as “composure” throughout. It will become
    apparent how and why “concentration” or “absorption” are highly
    inaccurate.

[^2]: Of course, this is not to say “easy” or “quick”, let alone
    formulaic, methodical, and comprehensible to the masses, but rather
    that it will be plainly obvious how, to use an analogy, it’s all
    been the growth and development of one and the same plant, without
    an introduction of alien factors. That growth and development is
    what is called the “Gradual Training” in the Suttas.

[^3]: And even before reaching freedom from sensuality, it would be
    clear that that’s where one is heading.

[^4]: cf. AN 6.73. Notice  the emphatic expression “seen correctly as it
    truly is with proper wisdom” (*yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya
    sudiṭṭhaṁ*). This Sutta alone should serve to disprove the idea of
    “pure *samādhi* without discernment”—a viable notion only when
    *samādhi* is taken to be the result of a repetitive exercise of
    attention and “no thinking”, something which is notably absent from
    the Suttas unless it’s being read into them. The standard
    instruction for abandoning the five hindrances in the Suttas
    (e.g. DN 2, MN 39, MN 107…) is nothing other than
    *contemplating* the drawbacks of those very five hindrances,
    regarding them as debt, illness, imprisonment, slavery and an
    uncrossed desert. An example of this practice will be given here.

[^5]: [Accomplished in
    Virtue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLRRaga5a2s)

[^6]: [Definition of a
    Fault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8dsFGYZbWI)

[^7]: Hence, falling into excessive clarification of the details of the
    rules to find out what is a fault is a mistake. The fault is in
    one’s own mind, and no amount of scholarly hair splitting of the
    texts can reveal that, but only self-honesty.

[^8]: Not that kindness is bad, but merely “feeling good” is an
    insufficient criterion.

[^9]: This alone takes a great deal of work and abandoning of ingrained
    views.

[^10]: I’ve chosen to render *cittassa* *nimitta* as “hint of the mind”
    to avoid the connotation of a mystical “sign” or “image” that would
    appear to one in the way a sight would. This is impossible if that
    *nimitta* is to be anything central to freedom from suffering, which
    it absolutely is.

[^11]: This does not mean, as it’s sometimes interpreted, that different
    “skilful means” are necessary at different times or for different
    people. It rather means that, if *any* approach to the practice from
    the Suttas is not freeing a person from the defilements, it’s
    because they still haven’t learned how to recognize those very
    defilements, not because “it’s not the right approach for them or at
    this time”.

[^12]: MN 9: *“When, friends, a noble disciple **understands** the
    unwholesome and the root of the unwholesome, the wholesome and the
    root of the wholesome, in that way he is one of right view, whose
    view is straight, who has unwavering confidence in the Dhamma and
    has arrived at this true Dhamma.”* This is why Right View is
    necessary for Right Recollectedness, let alone Right Composure.

[^13]: This is an instance where the famous passage from the Kālāmasutta
    is acutely relevant:

    > “Come, Kālāmas, do not go by (1)  oral tradition, by (2) lineage
    > of teaching, by (3) hearsay, by (4) a collection of scriptures, by
    > (5) logical reasoning, by (6) inferential reasoning, by (7)
    > reasoned cogitation, by (8) the acceptance of a view after
    > pondering it, by (9) the seeming competence \[of a speaker\], or
    > (10) because you think: ‘The ascetic is our guru.’ But when,
    > Kālāmas, you **know** for yourselves: ‘These things are
    > unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are
    > censured by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken,
    > lead to harm and suffering,’ then you should abandon them.”
    >
    > — AN 3.66

    If one does not see the hints of the mind, it is *impossible* that
    one’s virtue or meditation practice is based on anything apart from
    these 10 things. Hence the emphasis above on “take to be
    blemishes.” The actual blemishes of both virtue and mind will not be
    abandoned *simply because* what is a blemish is being believed,
    guessed, felt, surmised, reasoned, inferred… instead of *discerned*.
    Faith, learning and reasoning are indispensable, but success takes
    more than that.

[^14]: And in the case of breaking the five precepts (with complete
    celibacy as the fifth), the motivation cannot *not* be defiled.
    Pretty much everything else requires discernment of one’s underlying
    motivation to be categorized.

[^15]: And yes, it may be like this initially, but that’s only because
    one is still not sufficiently practiced in picking up the hints of
    where the faults lie internally.

[^16]: This includes a “meditation experience” in the contemporary
    sense. Anyone who has gotten one of those can ask themselves if it
    didn’t feel like an *acquisition* that they needed to *protect* and
    were afraid of losing. And yet the first *jhāna* is the *result* of
    detachment from all acquisitions. *“Here, **owing to withdrawal from
    acquisitions**… a bhikkhu dwells having entered the first jhāna.”*
    —MN 64

[^17]: Note how this is the *lowest possible stage* for a noble
    disciple. A case of “fulfils virtue but has no composure” is not
    mentioned, proving the intimate relationship between the two, also
    considering that such a disciple with up to 7 lives left would
    likely not be abiding in *jhānas* yet (cf. MN 13 and AN 3.95). And
    it will be clear how the virtue described here would eventually take
    one’s composure and discernment to this “moderate extent”, even when
    not dedicating a separate effort to them.

[^18]:
    > 1)  it is impossible that a bhikkhu who delights in company, who
    >     is delighted with company, who is devoted to delight in
    >     company; who delights in a group, who is delighted with a

[^19]: See SN 8.1 on the utter confidence in their virtue such a person
    would have, despite still not *fully* seeing the escape from the
    mental aspect of the unwholesome. That confidence reflects what
    *sammāsamādhi* is—immovability amidst things that try to move you.

[^20]: The understanding of one truth cannot but bring with it all the
    others. SN 56.30.

[^21]: [Abandoning of Sensuality is What Meditation
    Is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaexsS0MLas)

[^22]: See what ***precedes***, not ***results from***, practicing
    *sati* and *samādhi* in AN 8.63. Same in every Gradual Training
    sequence.

[^23]: *Sīlanussati*: One of the 4 recollections that recur throughout
    the Suttas, aimed at the abandonment of unwholesome states (cf. SN
    9.11). The first of these, recollection of the Buddha, is often
    taken to be the repetition of the mantra “buddho”. Does this mean
    the 4th, the recollection of virtue, simply entails using the word
    “sīlaṁ” as mantra instead? I think anyone familiar with the Suttas
    would agree that what follows below is more likely to be what the
    Buddha intended with those practices. If it were not, he could have
    saved a lot of time and simply focused on teaching how to use
    mantras or similar techniques properly, instead of leaving us with
    all these thousands of *contemplations*. Also, how exactly a mantra
    would lead to permanent freedom from *dukkha* is not evident
    here-&-now, as the Dhamma would always be.

[^24]: [Becoming
    Imperturbable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-039SYi2a94)

[^25]: Note well: This does not mean one should *seek* to have more
    temptations to break precepts in one’s environment—on the contrary.
    It just means that even after withdrawing as much as possible,
    temptations are bound to arise.

[^26]: This is really not optional in the way commonly assumed. The
    intention to stop one’s thoughts *before* fully developing the the
    actual first *jhāna*, let alone before even *having* it, is always
    underlied by a subtler, peripheral, not *directly* noticeable
    intention of desire/aversion, which people generally would not see
    because they can’t grasp the hints of such intentions and often
    aren’t trying to. Even if one succeeds in supposedly “not thinking”,
    that “little-yet-large” craving is lurking there and being
    blissfully ignored the whole time, no matter how much ecstatic
    pleasure is being felt. The proof is in how one would get even a
    tiny bit annoyed if the pleasure suddenly ceased, which wouldn’t be
    the case with the pleasure of *utter* *indifference to all gain and
    loss* that comes with wholesome *samādhi*.

[^27]: The term “intention” (*cetanā* or *saṅkhāra*) denotes a
    *possibility* that a sense experience presents to act in some way.
    “Volition” is the choice to act upon those possibilities, similar in
    practice to *kamma*, except in the case of the Arahant. See further
    explanation on “mental action” below.

[^28]: Translating “*phassa*” as “pressure”, a more practically useful
    rendering. Also note that feelings, perceptions, and intentions
    (*cetanā*) arise due to the base of *phassa*. Since *phassa* belongs
    to Māra, these 3 things must do so too

[^29]: It is not a coincidence that the tendency is to want to stop
    thinking, and in some cases shut down the 5 senses altogether (see
    AN 5.113). It is *because* one is too weak to endure the pressure
    that the objects exert that one wants to remove them, and a weak
    mind is a mind without *samādhi*. This, or one genuinely believes
    that the feeling accompanying the thought **is** the lust, which
    will make the cessation of lust impossible except by becoming a
    robot with “bare perceptions”, a rather popular notion that is
    actually nonsensical. Note also that *vedanā* are not *sensations*,
    they are mental phenomena.

    > “Feeling, perception, and consciousness, friend—these phenomena
    > are conjoined, not disjoined, and it is **impossible to separate
    > each of these phenomena from the others** in order to describe the
    > difference between them. For what one feels, that one
    > perceives; and what one perceives, that one cognizes.”
    >
    > — MN 43

[^30]: This applies even if one is not fully trying to “stop thinking”
    or “concentrate”, but still misusing Dhamma reflections to
    *prevent* thoughts arising on their own from exerting their
    respective pressure—still blaming the *hook* for the issue, not
    one’s biting of it.

[^31]: In brief: *citta* (sometimes rendered “heart”) is responsible for
    actions and all unwholesome states and is what needs to be purified,
    while *mano* (intellect), which is responsible for
    *dhammas* (thoughts/images), is Māra’s property and is where he sets
    up his “bait”. “Hint of the mind” refers to *citta*, not *mano*.

[^32]: [The Danger
    Contemplation](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/the-danger-contemplation/)

[^33]: Incidentally, people in the Suttas often became *sotāpannas* as a
    result of the Buddha expounding the danger of sensuality, with the
    sort of reflections exemplified here, which freed their mind from
    hindrances, and *then* the Noble Truths. It was not because they had
    been doing “concentration” practices before.

[^34]: [The Monkey Trap
    Sutta](https://youtu.be/A-eGHUsGmQA?si=Ep6SN56vDu7ostAE)

[^35]: Compare with the simile given in SN 12.66: The problem is
    *never* that the poisonous drink is tasty and agreeable, nor that
    it’s being offered— the problem is when *you* lose perspective and
    want to drink it.

[^36]: But you must also not be *anticipating* that result and getting
    anxious to get it, because this would be a subtler form of still
    craving for pleasure and against pain. Wanting is to be completely
    abandoned *beforehand*, and the “itch”  must be endured without
    expecting a reward at the end. *Samādhi* will not take care of your
    own craving for you, as is often hoped. *Samādhi *is the *result* of
    not acting out of craving, expectations and worries on any level.

[^37]: Isn’t it strange that “meditation” tends to involve
    “blindfolding” *oneself* by going into a trance, rather than
    blindfolding Māra? Note that indeed, the second jhāna *is* the
    cessation of thinking and pondering, but that is something that is
    *built upon the basis* of the pristine clarity of thinking of the
    first *jhāna*. So it’s not “blindfolding” oneself at all, but
    developing *even more* clarity of the nature of Māra’s traps. It’s
    then even harder to foolishly overlook and fall for them in the
    future.

[^38]: *Asubha* contemplation also tends to be misused to *get rid of
    the bait,* not to simply make sure to not eat it. Another way of
    grabbing it and being caught. [*On
    Asubha*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwxRFPkurhI)

[^39]: [The Truth About the Five
    Hindrances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UczBkf8eqxI)

[^40]: SN 53.1

[^41]: It’s not a coincidence that “patient endurance” appears in the
    first line and Nibbāna in the second. It’s not *just* talking about
    everyday “patience” and resilience. Also, one “does not disturb”, or
    argue even with Māra, trying to get him to stop putting up his traps
    in the six sense base that is rightly his. In this way, one can
    truly abandon all craving:

    > “Friend, I assert and proclaim \[my teaching\] in such a way that
    > one does not quarrel with **anyone** in the world with its gods,
    > its **Māras**, and its Brahmās, in this generation with its
    > recluses and brahmins, its princes and its people; in such a way
    > that perceptions no more underlie that brahmin who abides
    > **detached from sensual pleasures**, without perplexity, devoid of
    > worry, free from craving for any kind of being.”
    >
    > — MN 18

[^42]: This goes to show how even the first *jhāna* is something
    ***way*** more profound than it is usually given credit for
    contemporarily, often by putting too much weight on how *jhāna* is
    *technically* still not completely outside the realm of being
    (bhava). This is true from an *Arahant’s* point of view, but for the
    ordinary person who is not even accomplished in virtue and still
    relishes sensual pleasures, the first *jhāna* taught by the Buddha
    is, for all intents and purposes, close to Nibbāna—an
    *extinguishment* of their deeply rooted *sensual being (kāmabhava)*.
    To illustrate, a 60 year old has all the right to call a 30 year old

    such as that of Devadatta who had *jhānas*, but such people make
    history for a reason.
