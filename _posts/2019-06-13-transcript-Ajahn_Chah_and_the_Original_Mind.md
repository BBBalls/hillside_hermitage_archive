**Ven. Thaniyo:** This is another talk by Ajahn Chah called <cite>“The
Path to Peace.”</cite> Now, this is just a few paragraphs from it that I
found interesting. In this talk, Ajahn Chah gives a complete outline of
the practice. It’s about the middle of the talk that I’ll begin from:

<div class="{lang-en}">

> “At a certain point in the practice, you see that it is the mind which
> gives orders to the body. The body has to depend on the mind before it
> can function. However, the mind itself is constantly subject to
> different objects contacting and conditioning it before it can have
> any effect on the body. As you continue to turn attention inwards and
> reflect on the Dhamma, the wisdom faculty gradually matures, and
> eventually, you are left contemplating the mind and mind-objects,
> which means that you start to experience the body, rūpadhamma, as
> arūpadhamma, formless. Through your insight, you’re no longer
> uncertain in your understanding of the body and the way it is. The
> mind experiences the body’s physical characteristics as arūpadhamma or
> formless objects, which come into contact with the mind. Ultimately,
> you’re contemplating just the mind and mind-objects—those objects
> which come into your consciousness. Now, examining the true nature of
> the mind, you can observe that in its natural state, it has no
> preoccupations or issues prevailing upon it. It’s like a piece of
> cloth or a flag that has been tied to the end of a pole—as long as
> it’s on its own and undisturbed, nothing will happen to it. A leaf on
> a tree is another example. Ordinarily, it remains quiet and
> unperturbed. If it moves or flutters, this must be due to the wind, an
> external force. Normally, nothing much happens to leaves—they remain
> still. They don’t go looking to get involved with anything or anybody.
> When they start to move, it must be due to the influence of something
> external, such as the wind, which makes them swing back and forth.
> It’s a natural state. The mind is the same. In it, there exists no
> loving or hating, nor does it seek to blame other people. It is
> independent, existing in a state of purity that is truly clear,
> radiant and untarnished. In its pure state, the mind is peaceful,
> without happiness or suffering—indeed, not experiencing any feeling at
> all. This is the true state of the mind.”

</div>

**Ven. Nyanamoli:** That’s nothing other than seeing things arise as
phenomena, appear as phenomena, which they already are, because
phenomena, i.e. dhammā, are the objects of the mind, of mano, as a
sense. Most people in their day-to-day life don’t even see that because
they’re too absorbed with the sense world, and usually, that then
results in all the views as well. That’s why it’s so common to have the
assumption of the external public world that “we inhabit”—the world that
is independent of our experience, the “material” world; but you fail to
see that even your assumption of “material” is actually a phenomenon
arisen on the level of your thought, on the level of the dhammā, on the
level of the image in your mind. And that’s usually how people go about
in their day-to-day life: not even seeing the mind, the field where
these phenomena appear. So they’ve no signs of it, no recognition of it.
So then everything revolves around the assumptions of the material
world, interpretations based on that and so on.

Again, in itself, it’s still on the level of phenomena, but the only
difference is the person’s completely unaware of it; but a person can
become aware of it. So once you start recognizing that your own body—no
matter how material it is or how material it might “feel”—it still can
only be known as such because it has arisen on the level of that mind.
And in that sense, you realize “This, in a way, has nothing to do with
this matter that I’m thinking of, this matter that I assume; it’s the
opposite way: the matter that I think of and assume is only intelligible
because the thing is still there in the level of that mind as a
phenomenon,” and that’s what Ajahn Chah referred to as arūpa,
non-material. But even a material thing is known as such only because
that phenomenon has arisen on the level of your mind, which is
non-material. So that’s what he meant when he said the mind is the one
that governs and precedes these things structurally.

A person now might start thinking: “So I must find the immaterial” or
something like that. The arūpa that Ajahn Chah refers to—the phenomenal
nature of things—is within the material that you’re perceiving. It’s not
that you must abandon or deny or get rid of the material or stop
thinking it in order to see the immaterial: you just have to discern it
properly whereby you know that the arisen experience of the material
body right here, right now, is an image in your mind already. And that’s
these two tiers of existence, so to speak. Two domains: the simultaneous
presence of the material domain and the mental domain. Material is
inconceivable without the mental designation of it—without the mental
phenomenon being there simultaneously present; but, in the same manner,
there would be nothing present as a phenomenon on the level of the
mental domain if the actual physical rūpa is not there, still alive. So
nāmarūpa determines viññana, and viññana determines nāmarūpa to the same
extent, like the simile of the two reeds supporting each other: you
can’t separate them, you can’t investigate them independent of each
other—one implies the other. That’s just how it works. But in practical
terms, the way the experience proliferates, with lack of sense
restraint, sensuality and views, you drift away from that phenomenal
side of things that’s simultaneously there: you drift away from your
mind. That’s why the Buddha said it’s hard to see the mind correctly for
what it is. That’s why it’s a prerequisite for sotāpatti—seeing the
signs of your mind, seeing the domain of the phenomenal,
phenomenological, whatever you want to call it—because for most people
that’s completely overlooked.

**Ven. Thaniyo:** Do they go directly into the senses?

**Ven. Nyanamoli:** Yes. Usually, the entire attention gets absorbed,
even if you don’t necessarily proliferate it or are not wild and
unrestrained—just naturally—not discerning your mind means automatically
over-discerning that which comes from the senses, which then influences
all the views that you have on account of it, which is the public
material world independent of my experience, science, scientific measure
and data as the objective value. Again, independent of your experience,
failing to see that you cannot even conceive those things unless they
are your experience.

**Ven. Thaniyo:** For example, thinking: “When I die, this world will
continue.”

**Ven. Nyanamoli:** Exactly. All the wrong views can be boiled down to
the two fundamental points: “when I die the world will continue” or
“when I die I will continue, not the world.” Either way, it’s this
external projection of your experience as a whole, which is wrong, not
because some higher authority told you it is, but because it’s a
contradiction in terms. How can you even know something external of your
experience if that’s not already experienced? Which means, then, it’s
not external to your experience.

Parts of your experience present themselves based on your ignorance as
if they were independent of your experience, but you’re experiencing it,
and that’s a contradiction in terms. That’s why attavāda is one of the
first contradictions to go when you get the Right View: the assumption
of the external sense of self, independent of this experience. And that
will go when you realize that no matter how external it might feel, it’s
still experienced, which means it’s still internal in that manner. So it
doesn’t matter how material, how objective it is: the notion of
objectivity, the notion of materiality is on the level of the phenomenon
persisting in your mind that gives it it’s meaning. That’s why things
are significant and determined by the mind. That’s why the mind is the
forerunner—as the Buddha would say in the Dhammapada (verse 1 and 2)—the
forerunner of all things: without the mind giving it’s determination to
these things, there would be no experience; but now if you say “it’s all
in the mind”, that’s not true either because that mind wouldn’t be there
mirroring the phenomena if the matter is not there to be mirrored in the
first place, if the four great elements are not there.

**Ven. Thaniyo:** And it shows that inaccessibility of that matter to
you.

**Ven. Nyanamoli:** Exactly. The only way you can access it is the
indirect experience of it, which is not it, it exists because of it.

**Ven. Thaniyo:** And that’s anicca?

**Ven. Nyanamoli:** Exactly. That’s why the Mūlapariyāya Sutta (MN 1)
talks about that conceiving: “He conceives in matter,… apart from
matter,… thinks matter is mine,” and so on. He develops all these
attitudes towards that which is matter, failing to see that he can only
experience his experience of matter, not the matter—so his perception
can only perceive perception, his feeling can only feel feelings, his
intentions can only intend intentions—because assuming that you’re
perceiving the genuine rūpa means you are actually accessing that
external world of the four mahābhūta (the four great elements) and
that’s inconceivable. Hence, the slightest of those assumptions as
described in the Mūlapariyāya Sutta means that there is a conceiving of
“I am.” There is a conceiving of a separate entity that’s independent
and objective from the experience as a whole. That’s why the Buddha
referred to the four great elements, saying: “they cease to find
footing”—they don’t cease to be wherever they are, but they stop finding
footing in your experience. As in you stop conflating the perception
that has arisen on account of the four great elements being there with
the perception of the actual four great elements; but see, now, when you
think: “Oh, so the four great elements are something different”, that’s
also your perception on the level of your thought. So by no means of
grasping—by your thought, by your intentions—can you actually ever enter
the domain of the four great elements. So you realize all you have to do
is stop misconceiving it. That’s how it will stop finding the footing,
not by finding it where it is and removing it and so on: just stop
making the mistake of thinking that you can relate to it. And you will
keep making the mistake of relating to it for as long as you hold your
sense of self dearly because the relations with the world are the direct
result and also direct fuel for the sense of self.

So, if you’re willing to let go of that sense of self, you will then
have no reason to keep maintaining this gratuitous assumption of the
world external to you because the only reason you do that maintenance is
that that’s how you maintain your sense of self.

**Ven. Thaniyo:** What about, as Ajahn Chah is saying, “the state of the
mind”?

**Ven. Nyanamoli:** If you start recognizing that no amount of
materiality or objectivity can be found elsewhere except on the basis of
the mind, you realize the mind is the gateway—it doesn’t matter what
comes your way through your senses, good or bad, threatening or
agreeable and friendly—the mind is the basis, and in itself, on that
basis of the mind, things are quite indifferent. It’s your own attitude,
then, towards what comes through the mind, by not seeing that you want
to deal with it, prevent it, want more of it, indulge in sensuality,
engage in ill-will: because you don’t see that you don’t need to go and
chase these things out there; because even the assumption of “out there”
can only be known as such on the level of the phenomenon of your mind,
which means, you realize: “What if I just know it as a persisting,
enduring phenomenon right here, right now? I don’t need to go anywhere,
I just stay with this framework.” And then there will be no overly
delighting or trying to deny it to get rid of it, which means equanimity
will be a natural result.

**Ven. Thaniyo:** That’s what is there anyway, without “you”.

**Ven. Nyanamoli:** Absolutely. The mind and the body are there without
“you”. They don’t need your sense of self. So that’s why you can develop
equanimity. Because things, in themselves, are equanimous: they’re
indifferent to you. It’s your own passion and confusion—and passion that
comes out of that confusion—that confuses that whole thing; but if you
stop fueling that passion, confusion disappears, which means, then,
equanimity is restored because all you have is things that have arisen
and persist, and that’s it. It has nothing to do with you.

**Ven. Thaniyo:** I’ll continue with Ajahn Chah’s talk, “The Path to
Peace.” He continues:

<div class="{lang-en}">

> “The purpose of practice, then, is to seek inwardly, searching and
> investigating until you reach the Original Mind. The Original Mind is
> also known as the Pure Mind. The Pure Mind is the mind without
> attachment.”

</div>

**Ven. Nyanamoli:** That’s what I just said. You find the phenomena
there, and you realize the phenomena, the way they have arisen in that
mind, are already indifferent, already non-polluted by passion and lust,
and they can’t really be polluted. Your actions can be polluted by
desire and lust, but the persisting phenomenon is still the way it has
arisen, which means it’s impenetrable to your assumptions, your
cravings, your attachments. That’s why it needs constant maintenance: it
can never really get settled in these things that you’re attached to or
trying to get rid of or whatever, it’s only an attitude in regard to it;
but the thing in itself remains completely indifferent. So you recognize
that that true indifference, true equanimity comes from the things—the
way they have arisen—and you have no say, even if you want to have a
say.

**Ven. Thaniyo:** That’s the original state.

**Ven. Nyanamoli:** Exactly. And then you realize: “Things were always
like this, in a way. It was because I did not know that they were this
way that I kept assuming them to be different.”

**Ven. Thaniyo:** Ajahn Chah said further:

<div class="{lang-en}">

> “The Pure Mind is the mind without attachment. It doesn’t get affected
> by mind-objects. In other words, it doesn’t chase after the different
> kinds of pleasant and unpleasant mind-objects. Rather, the mind is in
> a state of continuous knowing and wakefulness, thoroughly mindful of
> all it’s experiencing. When the mind is like this, no pleasant or
> unpleasant mind-objects it experiences will be able to disturb it. The
> mind doesn’t become anything. In other words, nothing can shake it.
> Why? Because there is awareness. The mind knows itself as pure. It has
> evolved its own true independence, has reached its original state. How
> is it able to bring this original state into existence? Through the
> faculty of mindfulness wisely reflecting and seeing that all things
> are merely conditions arising out of the influence of elements,
> without any individual being controlling them.”

</div>

**Ven. Nyanamoli:** The mind gives the meaning, gives the significance,
simultaneously, to the present material domain; but without the material
domain, there would be nothing manifesting in the mind. It’s the two
reeds simile holding each other: it’s the “dyad”, as the Buddha referred
to it. And that’s the experience as a whole, back and front. That’s it.
Wherever you look, it’s within these two bases that are mutually
determined.

There is no room for your sense of self, for your ownership, for your
mastery. Or rather, your sense of ownership, as it is now, is within
that, which means it’s determined by that basis independent of your
sense of self. And the sense of self, that’s not in your own control…
Well, that’s not your self, then, is it? Because sense of self
implicitly declares ownership, mastery over experience. That’s why it’s
my self, my own self. So you realize that your own self depends upon
this basis that you’ve no say in, and that’s how your own self is not
yours. You realize the basis that’s not my self, that cannot be my self,
determines this sense of self, and it’s, because of that, not my self.
You actually learn how to perceive not-self with not-self, and that’s
what the Buddha was talking about in those various Suttas.

When Ajahn Chah talks about the “Original Mind”, again, you can mystify
that: you can think “Oh, it’s this pure bright mind that you just have
to tap into.” No, the “Original Mind” is right in front of you where
your thoughts are, where these appearances are. The way things arise,
you realize they have arisen on their own to that extent, and you’ve no
say in that. And that is that “originality” of it: it’s not your
mastery, your creation of those same things. You realize you can only
appropriate things to be “mine” because they were given beforehand:
they’ve arisen on their own so you appropriate them. You realize you
can’t even create anything in that sense; but it’s not like a delay—it’s
not like things have arisen and then you don’t see them—it’s the
simultaneous presence of these things enduring and your ownership of
that endurance, but you want to realize that that endurance cannot be
owned, that’s why you stop owning things. You can’t stop owning things
by trying to destroy them, get rid of them and say no to everything: you
can stop owning them by realizing that your ownership cannot belong to
you. Hence, it’s not ultimate ownership.

That is the “Original”, the “Pure Mind”, as Ajahn Chah said, that there
is no room for anyone there, in a way, means exactly that: inasmuch as
the mind gives a significance and recognition—it allows matter to
manifest on its basis—to that same extent without that matter, there
would be nothing for the mind to discern; so the matter is the measure
of the extent of the mind, and the mind determines the extent of the
appeared matter, and whichever way you look, it’s going to be determined
by the other. So “I am independent of this” becomes inconceivable to
even assume, but in order to see this correctly, a person has to stop
just focusing on things in front of them because these two levels I talk
about, that Ajahn Chah talks about, they’re not in front of you as two
objects. Only one can be in front of you. The other one is always behind
from where you look, and that’s what we spoke about in other talks: “the
peripheral.”

Learning how to see things peripherally without directly looking at them
because that’s where the mind is, that’s where phenomena are. But what
you see in front of you is the objects of your senses. That’s why people
are naturally, with the grain, automatically absorbed with the world and
senses and chasing pleasures: it actually takes effort to learn how to
see the context behind it, how to develop that peripheral vision without
needing to turn away and look at it because it won’t be peripheral then.
Like, I’m looking at you now, and I’ve all these things peripheral to
me, and they will remain peripheral if I keep looking at you, but if I
start looking at that… Well, that’s not peripheral anymore. Now that’s
the actual thing right in front of me. And that’s the point that you
must keep in mind when you try to discern what Ajahn Chah’s describing
here. Rūpa is what you’re staring at, arūpa would be everything around
it. You want to learn how to see arūpa as arūpa; you want to see the
peripheral as peripheral.

By the way, rūpa and arūpa are not quite used in this sense in the
Suttas, but Ajahn Chah used it on a practical level, and there’s nothing
wrong with that.

**Ven. Thaniyo:** So I’ll continue with the talk:

<div class="{lang-en}">

> “This is how it is with the happiness and suffering we experience.
> When these mental states arise, they’re just happiness and suffering.
> There’s no owner of the happiness. The mind is not the owner of the
> suffering—mental states do not belong to the mind. Look at it for
> yourself. In reality, these are not affairs of the mind, they’re
> separate and distinct. Happiness is just the state of happiness;
> suffering is just the state of suffering.”

</div>

**Ven. Nyanamoli:** Any phenomenon is a phenomenon in itself; that’s why
it’s independent of you. That’s why the Suttas say: “He knows the mind
affected with lust as mind affected with lust.” It’s not like “me
affected with lust.” There is lust present; there is non-lust present.
There is happiness present; there is sadness present. It’s enduring
inasmuch as sights are enduring, sounds are enduring and so on. Anything
that manifests, that is its nature: to be manifested. That’s it. So even
if it’s a weird, ambiguous thought, it’s real as such: as the experience
of an ambiguous thought. But it’s our own expectation of “concreteness”
which is fueled by that assumption of “material, public concreteness”,
so to speak, —the world independent of me— that prevents you from seeing
the mind, seeing the phenomena, seeing the Dhamma. That’s why dhammā
means, literally, “phenomena”. And then the Dhamma is the teaching of
the knowledge of the phenomena, of that which manifests.

**Ven. Thaniyo:** It’s right there.

**Ven. Nyanamoli:** Yes, it cannot be anywhere else. So it’s learning
how to see it correctly.

**Ven. Thaniyo:** Ajahn Chah says:

<div class="{lang-en}">

> “You are merely the knower of these things. In the past, because the
> roots of greed, hatred, and delusion already existed in the mind,
> whenever you caught sight of the slightest pleasant or unpleasant
> mind-object, the mind would react immediately—you would take hold of
> it and have to experience either happiness or suffering. You would be
> continuously indulging in states of happiness and suffering. That’s
> the way it is as long as the mind doesn’t know itself—as long as it’s
> not bright and illuminated. The mind is not free. It is influenced by
> whatever mind-objects it experiences. In other words, it is without a

> mental impression and get into a good mood. The mind forgets itself.
> In contrast, the original mind is beyond good and bad. This is the
> original nature of the mind. If you feel happy over experiencing a

> that is subject to impermanence and uncertainty. When you separate
> from the original mind, everything becomes uncertain—there is just
> unending birth and death, uncertainty and apprehensiveness, suffering
> and hardship.”

</div>

**Ven. Nyanamoli:** Yes, and you’re separated from the “Original
Mind”—you’re separated from that domain of phenomena, you don’t see them
as phenomena—when you never restrain your actions in regard to your
senses. The threshold of the being you are used to is on the level of
the senses and the pleasure or pain that comes from it. That’s why many
people would have the implicit attitude that even their own thoughts
don’t really exist, are not real: because the expectation of reality has
been proliferated so far out.

Going back to that “Original Mind”, as Ajahn Chah says, is not some
hidden reality behind all these appearances: it’s actually stopping to
misconceive the appearances for what they’re not, and that is its
original state. It was always there. That’s why arahantship is possible
in the first place. That’s why undoing of the wrong conceiving is
possible: because these things are truly independent of whether you
conceive them or not. So that’s why the sense of self is a problem:
because it’s a contradiction in terms. “Self” means mastery, ownership,
rulership of your experience. Yet you can only rule that which was given
to you beforehand, which means you’re not the ruler then because if you
were the true creator, master, ruler of these things, you would have
been creating it, you would have been truly independent of it. But your
whole existence depends on these things still being there so that you
can maintain your ownership in regard to it; but when that thing decides
to go, and it will—that’s why the Buddha encouraged reflecting on the
four great elements, how they change—you realize it’s inconceivable that
you would still exist in your domain of ownership. So, that’s not
ownership then, and you realize the only way to maintain that sense of
ownership of things around you is to ignore the fact that you cannot
actually own it. That’s why people don’t want to think about death
naturally—don’t want to think about losing their loved ones, losing
things they care about—because it’s implicit that it will happen, so it
just reminds them of the obvious. So you stop being ignorant by making
an effort to not ignore things. That’s it. Because ignoring things is
effortless. It’s with the grain of sensuality, the grain of ignorance;
not ignoring takes effort. But not ignoring is not like “resolving some
mystery of the universe.” You just need to stop ignoring the very things
that are in front of you: stop ignoring the broader context; stop
ignoring the peripheral to the actual; stop trying to get rid of the
states of mind you don’t like or that “should have not arisen.”

**Ven. Thaniyo:** You can just look at “mind-objects.”

**Ven. Nyanamoli:** Yes. That’s what we do when we do the questioning,
asking: “How am I feeling right now, fundamentally? Is it OK or is it
not OK?” And you realize you find that a state there enduring, and you
have no say in it. You may have lots of joy now because you feel OK, or
you have a bit of a pressure and unpleasant feeling because you don’t
feel OK, but that fundamental bit of whether it’s OK or not OK has
arisen on its own. Feeling has been manifested to its own extent, and
you have no say in that. That’s why I compare it to the weather that
comes and goes. You will act differently when the weather’s bad, you’ll
act differently when the weather’s good. In the same way, you’ll act
differently when there is a pleasant feeling than when there is an
unpleasant feeling, but that in itself is not necessarily the problem
until your actions delude you into believing that they are the
controller of the weather: they are the controller of the feelings. And
that’s why the Buddha would ask that person in that Sutta: “Well, if the
feeling is truly yours (as in you’re the controller), which one is it
then?” because they keep coming and going. Good feelings, bad feelings,
neutral feelings, but if you were truly the owner, you would only have
good feelings because ownership and pleasure go hand in hand. That’s why
you want to undermine that pleasure, not by trying to get rid of it, but
seeing that it cannot actually be yours—it hasn’t come from you. That’s
how you also undermine the ownership.
