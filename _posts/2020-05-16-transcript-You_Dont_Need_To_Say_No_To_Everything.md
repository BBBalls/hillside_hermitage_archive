**Nm:** What needs to be restrained? Do you say no to everything, to
whatever your eye wants to see or whatever your nose wants to smell? How
would you know what to say no to?

**Q:** Depends on my motivations.

**Nm:** So what would be the motivation for restraint?

**Q:** Wanting pleasure and not wanting pain.

**Nm:** Well, you always want pleasure, you always don’t want pain.
That’s the implicit starting point. Whatever you do it’s done for the
sake of pleasure, and you trying to say no to every desire, to
everything, will also be done for the sake of pleasure. So you’ll be
denying everything for the same reason, and therefore it won’t free you
from the problem.

The sole purpose of restraint is to develop context regarding your
motivations. You have to understand that you wanting to practice
restraint is rooted in the same desire, that’s what the Buddha meant
when he said desire is to be abandoned by the means of desire, but not
simply that desire can be abandoned through the desire, or that just by
craving, you will abandon craving, No, you crave for freedom from
craving initially, but if you start looking at the context of your
motivation, where things are rooted, what type of intention is behind
what you want to do, what you’ve done or what you’re planning to do,
that’s then how you make craving redundant. By avoiding doing things
that perpetuate craving, because not all things perpetuate craving. Not
all things perpetuate ignorance. Things that are rooted in lust,
aversion, and distraction perpetuate craving and ignorance.

Lust, aversion, and distraction are not IN things that you are doing.
They are in your motivations that make you act for those reasons. And
that’s what the Buddha said :

<div lang="en">

> “Thought and lust are a man’s sensuality,\\ Not the various things in
> the world;\\ Thought and lust are a man’s sensuality,\\ The various
> things just stand there in the world;\\ But the wise get rid of desire
> therein.”
>
> — <cite>AN 6.63</cite>

</div>

If you want to uproot lust, aversion and delusion, it’s not simply by
doing this and abstaining from that, it’s by knowing your intentions
behind your actions and refraining from acting out of the unwholesome.
But for that to be discerned you need to first restrain your habitual
action towards the beautiful/wanted, habitual action away from the
ugly/unwanted, habitual action from distracting yourself from boredom,
but not for its own sake, only for the sake to see how lust, aversion,
delusion are actually on the level of your intentions, your choices, and
not in the senses or sense objects.

That’s also how ‘virtue and duty’ is a fetter, it’s you assuming lust,
aversion, delusion to be in these things that you’re now abstaining
from, and by abstaining from it, you think that’s all you need to do. If
you think that your mission is accomplished, by abstaining from bad
things, you will not look for where the badness of bad things is rooted.
Which is in your intentions.

So when we talk about sense restraint, you take on the precepts, and
then within that, you see what the mind presents you with. If you say, I
will not do anything because everything is rooted in desire, that will
be rooted in desire. That’s your desire. If you say, I will stop
thinking, that is your thought. So you can’t just decide to step outside
of the problem. You are made up of the problem, your existence is the
problem.

So you take on the precepts, you take on sense restraint, on the level
of faith first, and now you go throughout your day, having to do things
and you can’t stop doing and you shouldn’t stop doing. You just want to
know where your motivation is rooted and if you wonder, how far to go
with that? Well, you go within the precepts. If things that are
presented to you to be done, would be breaking the precepts, you just
say no to that. You don’t need to overthink that side of things. But if
it’s within the precepts, doesn’t mean “Oh, I can do it justifiably
because it’s not breaking the precepts”, nor is it “I must deny
everything, because everything is rooted in desire”. No, the same thing
today can be rooted in one motivation, but tomorrow it can be rooted in
another motivation. But if all you see is the thing that you either
always say yes or no to, you’re never going to see your motivation,
which is where the whole problem has always been. The lust, aversion,
delusion can never step outside of the domain of your intention and
enter these things in the world. It always remains within your
intention.

First, you need to recognize your intention, your motivation, then the
more effort you make towards discerning it, the clearer the discernment
will become.

You might say “The problem is in the desire towards this and that. So
I’ll say no to that, but now I have a desire to say no to everything. So
I’ll say no to that”. So you just start saying no to more and more
things and wind yourself up completely and equally have no perspective
in as much as if you were engaging with sensuality. That’s like the
ignoble way of that self-mortification and denial of everything.

You have the precepts and within that, you question things, for example:
“I want to go for a walk. Why? Oh, because I’m restless. Okay, yeah,
that’s not the perfect motivation but is it a sensual motivation? Is it
because I’m hoping to experience a sight, sound, smell, taste, touch,
that will excite me? No, not specifically just because it’s too hot
under this roof and I want some breeze. Okay, that’s alright. I’m not
sure how ideal it is or not, but I know that it’s not as bad as
sensuality or as breaking the precepts”. So you do it. You go for a walk
because you want some breeze, you want some comfort. But then next time
that you want to go for a walk, you re-evaluate. You don’t just do it
again because you’ve done it before. So is it still rooted in comfort?
Yes. Is it still not rooted in sensuality? Yes. But can you perhaps
endure the discomfort and not go for a walk? You always want to see
where your motivation is rooted. Like, why do I want the breeze and the
comfort? Because I’m sleepy, and I’ll fall asleep, but if I go for a
walk, I’ll be awake and then I can spend more time diligently
practicing. If that’s the reason, then you don’t need to fear doing it.

You need to maintain perspective on your intent, and you will get to
know that perspective by keeping the precepts and practicing sense
restraint, by creating the boundary within which you can discern when
your mind moves towards or over the boundary of the precepts. That’s
also why the Buddha never allowed ascetic practices like living at the
root of a tree and so on, as mandatory because, for some, such actions
might be rooted in the unwholesome.

**Discern your intent behind your current situation, and say no to the
unwholesome.**

When you start doing this it will seem restrictive but when you get used
to it, you will see that a whole space opens up whereby you can do many
things which do not partake in or maintain the unwholesome. And by no
longer maintaining unwholesome intentions through acting out of them,
they will have to diminish and eventually cease.

Agreeable or disagreeable things do not cause your suffering, it’s your
intent which is the cause. Knowing your intent while keeping the
precepts, that’s how your mind will develop rightly, and if you get
confused about your intent just step back and question what your intent
is in trying to not be confused and in doubt, which will then reveal
your intent. Sometimes it is difficult to find your intent but it is
always right there, it’s the basis for anything you are about to do or
are doing.

**The clearer the perspective you have on the mind, the easier it will
be to not act on unwholesome intentions.**

People act habitually, addictively because there is no perspective on
their situation. Once the perspective is increased through one’s effort
then what constitutes sense restraint is self-evident. You only restrain
things that are rooted in the unwholesome, you don’t restrain everything
because that’s like starving yourself to death. Initially and more often
than not, you might need to be restraining more than usual, to be on a
safer side. That’s why the Buddha would always lean on the side of
asceticism\*, even if in itself it does not necessarily result in
wisdom. Just don’t become neurotic and say no to everything. Because
that means that you’ll lose context and won’t be aware of your intent.
