an essay

by **Ajahn Nyanamoli Thero**



How should one free oneself from suffering?

The very first step that one should make is to learn how not to *crave*
the cessation of suffering. At first glance this might seem simple, but
actually it is not so straightforward at all; for we cannot assume that
an untrained, ordinary person even knows what truly suffering is.

In order to know <span lang="pi">*dukkha*</span> it is not enough just
to suffer. To know <span lang="pi">*dukkha*</span>, one has to
recognize, within the present experience, what *is* and what *is not*
necessary. The point is that, in the experience of pain, certain aspects
are inevitable, while others, are not. In different words – the
‘painfulness’ of pain is suffering and not the pain itself.

Let me get back to the opening statement that one should not crave the
cessation of suffering; why is that essential? The *immediate reason* of
our suffering, as the Buddha tells us, is our craving or
<span lang="pi">*taṇha*</span>. It is because of
<span lang="pi">*taṇha*</span> that our experience of pain is *painful*.
This applies to the other two kinds of feeling too. Thus, we can say,
that it is because of craving that *feelings* are
<span lang="pi">*dukkha*</span>. In the first type, unpleasant feeling,
craving for the *cessation* of that feeling causes one to suffer: the
painful feeling is present there, directly opposed to one’s desire for
it to not-be, to disappear. In this way a discrepancy is created, a
discrepancy which is nothing but <span lang="pi">*dukkha*</span>. In the
second type, pleasant feeling, craving for *more* of that feeling is
manifested, thus the *actual* pleasant feeling appears as unpleasant,
when attended from the direction of that increased pleasure which is
*craved for*. The present feeling of pleasure becomes inadequate, a lack
which needs to be satisfied. Again, the discrepancy arises, which one
tries to overcome by a further pursuit of various things in the world
which, will *intensify* his pleasure further. One hopes that such
attempt will ‘fill the gap’ within, but needless to say, that is
impossible since the discrepancy is actually being constantly
*generated* by the presence of <span lang="pi">*taṇha*</span>, and *not*
by the various objects in the world.

<div lang="en">

> “Thought and lust are a man’s sensuality,  
> Not the various things in the world;  
> Thought and lust are a man’s sensuality,  
> The various things just stand there in the world;  
> But the wise get rid of desire therein.”
>
> — <cite>AN VI 63 / iii, 411</cite>

</div>

When it comes to third type, neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feelings
(i.e. neutral), suffering is experienced as a result of one craving *for
feelings* themselves, since neutral feeling is not recognized at all:

<div lang="en">

> “Neutral feeling is pleasant when known \[as such\],  
> and unpleasant when not-known \[as such\]”
>
> — <cite>MN 44 / i, 303</cite>

</div>

So, to summarize, one’s experience of pain is *not* the reason for one’s
suffering. It is rather the presence of craving, in one’s experience,
that suffering *is there*. As long as this remains the case, one will be
a “victim” of one’s own feelings, be they pleasant, unpleasant or
neutral.
