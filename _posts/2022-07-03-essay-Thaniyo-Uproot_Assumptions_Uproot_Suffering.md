<u>Bodily pain and mental suffering</u>

Having a body means that one will experience pleasure and pain but that
does not mean that the mind is bound to be emotionally affected, as in,
the various forms of joy or misery that appear simultaneously with what
is felt, are gratuitously arisen, they are not what a feeling is but are
consequences of assuming what a feeling is, and so to bring an end to
that emotional suffering, one has to remove that assumption.

Not knowing that there is an assumption regarding a feeling, one
delights in or resists it, and to that extent, depending on the
intensity of the feeling, a corresponding emotion is also present. When
the assumption is removed, then no matter the intensity of the feeling,
no emotional suffering is possible.

The gratuitous assumption is that a feeling is “for me, mine, and
myself”. That assumption cannot easily be removed by merely believing
that whatever is felt is not mine. Even though the belief is accurate,
that nature of feeling not being mine needs to be clarified through
repeated contemplation and real-life application by way of not acting
out of craving regarding a feeling. It takes a great amount of effort to
remove such an assumption because it is literally who you are.

The undoing of your self-view is the only way that one can, after an
indeterminate amount of time, be free from suffering a feeling.

The common and natural way that a person tries to not suffer is to
manage pleasure and pain with the intent to increase the pleasure or get
rid of the pain. However, no matter how skilled one becomes at such
management, the main problem which is the gratuitous assumption of
ownership remains and as such that management can never bring liberation
from suffering because it is just another symptom of the problem,
another emotional response toward a feeling assumed as self. Acting out
emotionally by way of management so that one can no longer suffer a
feeling is a contradiction and a futile attempt because no amount of
increase in the symptoms (the emotions) will cure the disease (of
suffering). No amount of feeding the liability to suffer can cure the
liability to suffer. One could *manage* pleasure and pain by patiently
withstanding it without acting out of craving to increase or decrease
the feeling, and as such, the pressure of craving a feeling would still
be present, however, the only difference would be that as one patiently
withstands (I.e does not act out of craving), one also simultaneously
tries to remove the assumption of ownership through clarifying the
nature of feeling and by doing so the pressure of craving (suffering)
would diminish. That would be *Middle-way management*, which also helps
you cope but it destroys the problem, as opposed to emotional management
which only helps you cope with the problem you keep feeding.

One can restrain oneself from acting out angrily and succeed but such
restraint will not uproot the problem from causing more symptoms that
stem from ‘identification with feeling and craving against pain’ to
arise again. The restraint is necessary but understanding is crucial if
one wants to no longer need restraint management.

Many parents learn management skills from raising their young, they
learn to endure the burden of discomfort through various coping
mechanisms, and as a result, can take on a lot more pain. However,
despite that type of discipline, they still get angry, they still have
to try to be patient, and still have to employ some kind of management
technique in which to cope with their internal resistance towards pain,
their anger - their suffering.

Coping with one’s mental anguish is good but not good enough because it
means that one is still not exempt from suffering, it just means that
one has learned how to cope within the given parameters. The problem is
that those parameters do not stay the same. Circumstances change and can
bring various challenges that one may not be able to handle. Challenges
that could overwhelm even the most hardened individual. Take the case of
a military person who can deal with many life-threatening painful
situations, who can put their bodies through extreme pains, yet the loss
of a loved one will bring them to tears, from which they may never
recover. Despite enduring vast amounts of pain, there may still arise a
pain so tremendous that one cannot mentally cope.

<u>Delighting in the body, one’s mind is obstructed</u>

Another assumption that the common untrained person has is that this
body is “for me, mine, myself”. With such an assumption, attention is
then absorbed into sensory experiences. This means that when the body is
tired - the mind is clouded, when the body is heated - the mind is
lustful, when the body is in a neutral state - the mind is bored, when
the body is agitated - the mind is annoyed. When the mind is absorbed
with delight into the wild and untamed senses, the mind is hindered by
them, it is overwhelmed by lust, anger, restlessness, dullness,
confusion, and so on.

Delighting in the body means that one’s mind gets dragged around by the
body and as such one’s mental well-being is founded upon the bodily
state which is prone to change, which means for that person, equilibrium
of mind and long-term happiness is not a realistic goal. At most, they
can only undergo happiness or a sense of success for as long as there is
a comforting or pleasurable sense object manifesting for them.

How then can one be at peace no matter the bodily state or present
feeling? How to not suffer no matter what?

<u>Adopting a view to cope with suffering</u>

I could hope that everything will work out in the end. I could think
that bodily death will result in my eternal happiness. But none of those
beliefs or assumptions will result in an assurance, here and now, that I
am free from suffering or that I will never suffer again. Those beliefs
only help me cope once again with the fact that I suffer now, that I am
still susceptible to suffering, and that I do not know how to escape
such a situation.

I can resign to ideas like: “Such is life. That’s the way it is. This
too will change. God has a plan, etc”, and on account of those
concessions, I will feel some relief which doesn’t last very long, so I
will have to repeat those ideas like mantras, or scroll for another
uplifting quote, trying once again to help myself get along with the
fact that I do and can suffer.

What then is the escape from being subject to suffering? How can I no
longer need coping mechanisms? The common way to try and escape
suffering is through chasing a pleasant feeling, which results in one
trying to set up assurances through insurance policies, savings,
investments, vows of fidelity, dietary programs, skill acquisitions,
meditation programs, exercise routines, family development, property
acquisition, and any other form of ownership that will seemingly give
the result of having permanent access to pleasure. One goes about trying
to control the situation, trying to stabilize the unstable, through the
proliferation of ownership for the everlasting access to pleasure, which
is one’s only relief plan from the fundamental discomfort of existence
taken personally.

<u>Acquisition and distraction</u>

Those attempts at management rely on the fact that one is subject to
suffering. If one was no longer liable, then those attempts, those
various investments would no longer be emotionally needed. But as we
know, even if a person can own a vast empire, or control many things,
his acquisitions are based on a situation that is already out of his
control, a situation that is fundamentally unownable, thus his attempt
to own and control, and likewise with his adherence to certain
meditation techniques or spiritual practices and views. If he were to
reflect on this fundamental futile undertaking, he would most likely
drown in sorrow. Therefore various ‘acts of distraction’ that give him a
sense of security and help him from not facing the truth, become
priceless. Such is the value of the entertainment industry or the
significance of industry in general. (music, movies, culinary
explorations, travel, art, socializing, building, planning, religion,
retreats…)

All industry then can be seen as an attempt to satisfy one’s need for
freedom from suffering, yet the industry is built upon that suffering.
It is fueled by the existence of one’s personal liability to suffer, and
to stop such industrious activities, would result in one coming face to
face with one’s suffering that one has been trying to outrun. Hence the
apprehension of having nothing to do, the fear of solitude, stillness,
or peace.

So once again, how to solve this problem? Should we stop all activities?
No, because not all activities fuel the problem. It is only the
activities of acting out of craving and holding an assumption that needs
to be stopped for the problem to an end.

<u>Managing my personal feelings is no cure</u>

Our management acts such as chasing pleasure will never end in
contentment because there will always be a need for more since pleasures
to be had are infinite and subject to change. However, despite the
nature of feeling being so evident yet subtle, we do not know it and
therefore the assumption that the only way to escape suffering is
pleasure is maintained and fueled by the assumption of ownership of
feeling, even though it’s obvious that feeling is not mine because if it
were I wouldn’t be chasing it down. Such is the ordinary absurd mode of
existence.

If pleasure is the escape from suffering then how much of it is required
to result in never craving pleasure again?

One can think of all the pleasures that one has had and see that it
hasn’t worked out because still, you are subject to suffering. This
realization could leave you discouraged, this realization that you
cannot get all the pleasures that you desire and therefore it would be
impossible for you to be free from suffering… “Unless I win the
lottery!”, you may think, which might give you some glimmer of hope,
“Maybe just one big boost of pleasure would solve the problem?

If you are at least understanding that the pleasures that could be had
are infinite and your assumption that “pleasure is the escape from
suffering”, will result in a never-ending story of dissatisfaction
because of pleasure being in its nature subject to change and
un-ownable, then you should investigate further, for example, “Is
pleasure even necessary in the first place? I chase pleasure because I
think that,”Without it, I will continue to suffer”, so it seems vital.
One assumes that it will cure ones suffering, but then when pleasure
arises it is felt as though it’s not enough, and then it ceases sometime
later and my suffering remains unchanged, which means that the pleasure
that I worked so hard for, did not remedy my liability to suffering or
even decrease its existence in any way. Therefore, pain is not the cause
of my liability to suffering, because experiencing pleasure is not the
cure. When I feel pleasure, I suffer for it to be, when I feel pain, I
suffer for it to not be. Either way, my liability to suffer remains
steady.

<u>What exactly is the cause of my suffering?</u>

When I suffer, I crave for it to disappear. That attitude, subtle as it
is, is an attempt to get away from suffering, and so from the start, on
that level, I begin the hopeless activity of trying to get rid of
suffering by fueling it through my blind act of devotion towards chasing
pleasure and contempt for pain.

One who has some self-reflexive abilities might then begin to challenge
those gratuitous assumptions that pleasure is good and that it results
in non-suffering, or that pain is bad, that it causes one to suffer and
must be gotten rid of by any means necessary especially by the means of
pleasure which is fundamentally good because that is what I am.

Is pleasure really good? Is it mine? We can already see that it carries
no usefulness as a means of escape from suffering and no amount of
assumed ownership changes that. Is pain the source of our suffering? We
can see through these reflections that if the pain is the source, then
escape is impossible because pain is always possible despite
experiencing pleasure.

Ordinarily, when someone suffers pain, they automatically try to get rid
of it, because they fundamentally, without question, don’t want to feel
it and assume that pain is the problem and pleasure is the solution.
Failing to see that if that were the case, they would already no longer
have a problem and therefore no longer need a solution.

There is pain and there will be pain. If I had a say in that, there
would be no pain, to begin with, but there is pain, therefore I have no
say in that. And when I resist it, I suffer it. When I try to make it
not be, when I think that the pain which is not in my control, is in my
control, I foolishly maintain my suffering. Again, if it were mine to
control, then it would not exist in the first place.

One can realize that this pain, which has arisen by whatever means it
has arisen, is not mine because it has appeared. I feel it but I do not
own it. This type of contemplation helps one to restart, so to speak,
from a place of what is true rather than from a place of assumption, or
ignorance, and if we want to get down to the bottom of our suffering to
uproot its cause, then we have to start seeing what we are doing wrong,
we need to see what is occurring and this requires us to not
automatically react by struggling to get rid of pain and delighting in
pleasures and to be honest with ourselves about the failure in the
previous means by which we were trying to be free from suffering.

I can delight in pleasure and I can hate pain, but either way pleasure
and pain will arise and my delight and hate will not make any difference
but will maintain the fact that when there is a feeling, and there is
always a feeling, I will be emotionally affected one way or another.

All this means is that suffering is not caused by what is felt, but is
rooted in my gratuitous assumption of ownership and my attitude towards
it. If I did not resist my pain, I could not have an emotional state of
anger, which requires resistance against my pain. If I did not delight
in my pleasure, I could not have an emotional state of passion, which
requires delighting in my pleasure.

<u>Detachment from feeling</u>

Feeling arises and ceases due to conditions that are also not my own,
and while that happens, I am never its owner, my attitude of resistance
towards it provides me with no protection from suffering and makes it
worse, and things are only bad because I have unknowingly made them so
through my gratuitous assumptions about what I am experiencing.

A feeling manifests blind to our attitudes, emotions, and sense of
ownership. A feeling doesn’t even know we exist, and how could it, it is
just a feeling that feels.

Such realizations and repeated considerations along the right lines of
the Middle-way application will slowly result in detachment from feeling
i.e, the letting go of feeling through the destruction of assumptions.
Such an indirect letting go of what is felt, on account of understanding
that one can never hold on in the first place, directly results in an
increase in non-agitation regarding an arisen feeling, it results in a
more peaceful mind and body which are no longer emotionally charged up
through an assumption of ownership and desperate attempts to control
what is felt. The feeling is just left alone and one is no longer
touched by it, so to speak, because one no longer touches it by taking
it personally.
