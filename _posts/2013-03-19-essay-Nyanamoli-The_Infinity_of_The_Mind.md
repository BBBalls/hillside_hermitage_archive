<span lang="pi">*Pabhassaram*</span>—this could be translated as
‘bright’, and it should be regarded as something lit up, shining,
effulgent or *lucid*. To find out how this term should be understood,
one can bring to mind the term
<span lang="pi">*ākāsa*</span>—space—which literally means ‘shining
forth’, in the sense of a space which is lit up. In <cite>MN 49</cite>,
we can see that consciousness is referred to as
<span lang="pi">*viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ anantaṃ sabbato pabhaṃ*</span>,
where ‘non-indicative’, ‘infinite’ (or endless, limitless) and
‘completely radiant’ (i.e. utterly and fundamentally lucid, not to be
understood in a sense of mystically beaming rays of light or similar),
are the terms referring to <span lang="pi">*viññāṇa*</span>.[^1] The
whole point is that ‘brightness’ is an epithet describing the inherently
*infinite structure* of the mind, which is ‘defiled’ by the obstructions
(i.e. made *finite*). In <cite>SN 35.202</cite> the Buddha said:

<div lang="en">

> How, friends, does one not leak? Here, friends, having seen form with
> eye, a monk does not incline towards pleasing forms, he is not
> affected by displeasing forms. He lives aware of the body there and
> with mind that is boundless.

</div>

A monk can dwell and live his life with a “boundless mind”.[^2] [^3] He
has understood the nature of the body *there* together with the arisen
structure of the present experience,[^4] which is infinite. By
understanding the infinite or boundless, any boundaries and finiteness
that were present as a result of that lack of understanding, are
removed. In other words, the ‘brightness’ or ‘lucidity’ or ‘infinity’ or
‘boundlessness’ are the ways of describing the *property* of the
fundamental structure of experience, which is the very reason why
overcoming the obstructions is possible.

<span lang="pi">*Āgantuka*</span>—here it is translated as
‘superimposed’. It can also mean adventitious, incidental, accessory.
The main point that has to be borne in mind is that the ‘obstructions’
are “incidental”, in the sense that they are not caused by the
<span lang="pi">*pabhassaramidaṃ cittaṃ*</span>, but are nevertheless
there. The defiling obstructions do not have anything in common with the
brightness of the mind; they are simply “layered” there, superimposed
without actually affecting the infinite structure. Thus, since the
infinite mind does not need those obstructions, it can be rightly said
that they are completely gratuitous.[^5]

So, obstructions, or more precisely <span lang="pi">*avijjā*</span>,
have no *first point* when they are manifested before which mind was
pure, bright and unpolluted. Because of this it is not correct to refer
to ‘bright mind’ as an *original thing*, as if it existed in a pure
state *before* the obstructions arrived. Since there is no beginning to
the infinity, nor to the beginningless <span lang="pi">*avijjā*</span>,
the notions of “first this, then that” have no place to apply. So how
shall this evident priority of the ‘bright mind’ be understood then? The
answer is straight—in an atemporal, structural sense. The infinity of
the mind precedes <span lang="pi">*avijjā*</span> ontologically, so to
speak, while they are there both, *simultaneously present.* This should
also shed some light onto why the structure of the mind does not imply
nor require the obstructions (hence they are called ‘obstructions’)—they
are superfluous, unnecessary, superimposed. Yet, the
<span lang="pi">*uppakilesā*</span> are there, and are not to be found
elsewhere.[^6] To put this all in different words: the infinity of one’s
mind is a temporally more fundamental than one’s own nescience in regard
to it. Furthermore, it is because of the nescience in regard to the
*nature of infinity*, that *avijjā* is *a beginningless phenomenon*. If
infinity has no beginning, how could the fundamental ignorance of that
be different?

This is not all, there are further implications of one’s ignorance of
the infinite structure—namely, *permanence*. The uninstructed worldling
confuses the notion of infinity (no beginning, no end) with the notion
of *eternity*, or rather *identifies* the two. In this way, a present
experience is regarded as eternal or permanent. What a
<span lang="pi">*puthujjana*</span> does not see is that eternity
implies infinity, but the infinity does not imply eternity.[^7] Because
of the nescience in regard to this, the
<span lang="pi">*puthujjana’s*</span> experience of infinity *assumes*
permanence. In other words, his <span lang="pi">*citta*</span> is
regarded as permanent; he regards his Self as permanent. If one would be
able to see the infinity without eternity, or even to see it as
impermanent, the notion of Self, and everything else that depended upon
it, (which required the notion of permanence), would cease without a
remainder. Knowing infinity as something present (i.e. arisen) but
impermanent (for the very reason that it has *arisen* on its own
accord), clears the mind of any obstructions, any superimposed
interferences with the infinite structure. Hence it is said that the
<span lang="pi">*arahant’s*</span> mind is *immeasurable.*[^8] His
*citta* has been developed to the structurally more fundamental state,
and it is because this state was always *possible* (but not
*actual*)[^9] that transcending the obstructions was feasible. In other
words, if one’s mind was *inherently*
ignorant—i.e. <span lang="pi">*avijjā*</span> structurally preceded any
experience—arahantship would not be possible. [^10] [^11]

[^1]: Ñāṇavīra Thera took <span lang="pi">sabbatopabhaṃ</span> to be
    <span lang="pi">sabbato-apahaṃ</span> (from
    <span lang="pi">apahoti</span>, <span lang="pi">a+pahoti</span>), in
    which case this compound would be synonymous with anidassanaṃ,
    ‘non-indicative’ or ‘not-producing’ (Self). (Cf. Ñāṇavīra
    Thera—<cite>Clearing the Path</cite> (2010), ‘Note on
    Paṭiccasamuppāda’, footnote j, p.28). Whether he was right or wrong
    in reading it like this, it is clear here that either way the
    context is scarcely affected—the infinity of consciousness does not
    indicate Self, does not produce Self, and it is fundamentally lucid,
    radiant, and unobstructed.

[^2]: Cf. <cite>MN 38</cite>.

[^3]: This also indicates that the states of ‘boundlessness’, ‘infinity’
    and similar that are mentioned in the Suttas are not exclusively
    reserved for “meditation attainments”, as they are commonly
    regarded.

[^4]: Cf. “There is just this body and name-and-form externally…” —
    <cite>SN 12.19</cite>.

    “Craving, however, is a gratuitous (though beginningless) parasite
    on the intentional structure described here, and its necessity is
    not to be deduced from the necessity of intention in all experience.
    Intention does not imply craving—a hard thing to understand! But if
    intention did imply craving, arahatta would be out of the question,
    and there would be no escape.” \> \> — Ñāṇavīra Thera, op. cit.,
    footnote f, p. 56.

[^7]: The reader might notice that Ñāṇavīra Thera in ‘Fundamental
    Structure’ (op.cit. p. 107) refers to the endurance of a thing as
    ‘eternal’. This structural ‘eternity’ is what is meant here by
    ‘infinity’. It is just how one decides to designate these terms. If
    we were to choose the term ‘eternal’ to describe the property of the
    structure, we would additionally have to qualify it by saying: “A
    thing endures for ever. A thing is eternal… until it ceases.” I,
    personally, prefer ‘infinite’ so that the distinction between the
    inherent nature of the arisen experience (infinity) becomes apparent
    from the <span lang="pi">puthujjana’s</span> appropriation of it
    (eternity).

[^11]: For these very reasons the Buddha was able to “rediscover” the
    path which lay there. For more cf. <cite>SN 12.65</cite>.
