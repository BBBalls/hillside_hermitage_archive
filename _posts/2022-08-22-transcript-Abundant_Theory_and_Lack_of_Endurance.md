title: 281hh- Abundant Theory and Lack of Endurance
---

**Q:** In terms of <span lang="pi">*anatta*</span>—a regular person
acknowledges their mortality and realizes that they don’t have full
control over their body. However, they still take things personally and
view their body as their own, even though they know they will die.

**Ajahn Nyanamoli:** Why is that?

**Q:** It’s because of their behavior. Their actions reflect the belief
that they have control.

**Nm:** Exactly. You can have all the right ideas, but if your behavior
doesn’t align with those ideas, you’re reinforcing incorrect
assumptions. So, even though you understand in theory the nature of
existence, your habits and carelessness lead you towards sensuality,
resisting discomfort, overindulging in food, and in general failing to
restrain your senses. That’s where your wrong views are being sustained.
Your actions are in line with a sense of entitlement, control, and the
idea that you will live forever, despite your beliefs being different.
So, you need to act on your right ideas. You need to start purifying
your behavior to mirror those ideas.

There were, as it states in the <span lang="pi">Suttas</span>,
<span lang="pi">sāmanas</span>, and <span lang="pi">brahmins</span>
outside of the Buddha’s teaching who also had some right ideas that they
cultivated, for example:

<div lang="en">

> ‘I am not anything belonging to anyone anywhere, nor is there anything
> belonging to me in anyone anywhere.’
>
> — <cite>AN 4.185</cite>

</div>

<div lang="en">

> <span lang="pi">Bhikkhu</span>s, of views held by outsiders, this is
> the foremost, namely: ‘I might not be and it might not be mine; I
> shall not be, and it will not be mine.’
>
> — <cite>AN 10.29</cite>

</div>

They realized that things are quite circumstantial, including the sense
of control. It can end at any moment. And the Buddha said that that is
the foremost of the outsiders’ views. The point was that, if you do not
just think that view once a month, but start, whenever you want to act
towards the world, towards him, her, or this, or that, you put that view
first: “*I am not anything belonging to anyone anywhere, nor is there
anything belonging to me in anyone anywhere, or* *‘I might not be and it
might not be mine; I shall not be, and it will not be mine.’*” And by
doing so you would not be able to engage in passion, aversion, or
distraction.

**Q:** For example, I might logically reason that feelings are not mine
because they’re subject to change. I can see that and it kind of mirrors
that right view in theory. I understand in theory that it’s impermanent,
or inaccessible to my control. And now, as I feel pain, what do I do?

**Nm:** Are you trying to get rid of it or are you unmoved by it?
Inevitably, you’ll be trying to get rid of it by using those ideas of
<span lang="pi">*anicca*</span> etc. But, if you then really start to
understand those ideas, you realize, thinking about the
<span lang="pi">Dhamma</span> does not mean that’s the
<span lang="pi">Dhamma</span>. So you can have all the right ideas, but
if you’re not applying them rightly, there is no
<span lang="pi">Dhamma</span> there. And that’s important to recognize
because otherwise, you can easily slip into a view of ‘Well, as long as
I think about the <span lang="pi">Dhamma</span>, I am on the path’. But
you’re not. You’re on the path when you become a
<span lang="pi">*sotāpanna*</span>. That’s the beginning of the path. If
you don’t see the <span lang="pi">Dhamma</span>, it means you don’t see
the path. How can you be on the path if you don’t see the path? And you
will not become a <span lang="pi">*sotāpanna*</span> just on account of
such ideas. You need to start applying them, and enduring things on the
right level.

**Q:** So you could say feelings are not mine…

**Nm:** Great, in theory, you’ve got it. So what do you do? Let’s say
there is a prospect of pleasure. What do you do in the face of the
prospect of pleasure?

**Q:** I don’t delight in it.

**Nm:** And what else? Do you act towards it? Follow it?

**Q:** No, I endure it.

**Nm:** For how long?

**Q:** Forever.

**Nm:** Exactly. So, if those are the truths that you understood, that
you accepted, that you intellectually verified as correct, now you start
doing it. This feeling is not mine…It’s not in my control, it’s a trap,
it’s suffering…

**Q:** But say in the beginning, I am faced with feeling, a feeling is
pressuring me, it’s touching me, it seems like mine. But I have the
outside view of the Buddha saying that it’s not- mine…

**Nm:** It seems like yours, but there is an option there. Do you accept
the pressure as yours or as not-mine ? It is presented as yours, as for
you, but that doesn’t mean you have to accept that at face value. It’s
similar to how a fisherman casts a baited hook, tempting the fish to
bite. The bait is presented as something beneficial for the fish to
take, but ultimately it’s meant to hook and trap it. You might not see
that trap immediately, but at least you know, as long as I don’t take
this, I won’t be hooked.

Overall it’s important to recognize that <span lang="pi">Dhamma</span>
begins with <span lang="pi">*sotāpatti*</span>, not with the ideas of
<span lang="pi">Dhamma</span>, and even the clarity you might have.
Because if you do, you will be creating that discrepancy between your
ideas that you’re convinced are putting you on the path of
<span lang="pi">Dhamma</span>, and your behavior that is still not
matching it. Your lack of endurance, your lack of recognition on that
right level, lack of restraint regarding the need to manage discomfort
and unpleasant things. But if you don’t have such a view, and you
recognize ‘Yes, these ideas, as clear and as pleasing as they are, they
might be very right, and I might verify later on that I was spot on
right from the start. But the only way I’ll do that is not through
holding these views about the ideas and so on, and feeling safe on
account of it. No, let me now apply those views in regard to sensuality,
aversion, and distraction.’ Only three things. You don’t need to seek
verification anywhere else.

**Q:** That’s the only way you will ever be able to verify the
<span lang="pi">Dhamma</span>. Because I can have a view, and you can
agree with my view. We can both agree that feelings are not self…

**Nm:** … and we can write scholarly papers on it, dissertations, and
pages and pages of references, and create a whole network of
information. But that’s not the <span lang="pi">Dhamma</span>. That’s
the information about the <span lang="pi">Dhamma</span>.
<span lang="pi">Dhamma</span> is when things are endured on the right
level.

**Q:** So, I understand that feelings are not my own. They don’t belong
to me. They just come and go.

**Nm:** Great. Now, when things come and go, let them come and go
without acting out of them, without trying to get rid of them, without
delighting in them, without welcoming them.

**Q:** And keep doing that.

**Nm:** For as long as it takes. And it might take forever.

**Q:** The verification that it has worked, is the fact that feelings no
longer pressure you.

**Nm:** Eventually, yes. The pressure felt will diminish. There will be
no pressure in the end. That’s why <span lang="pi">*phassa*</span> -
pressure, can not pressure the groundless one when there is no ground to
apply that pressure. An <span lang="pi">Arahant</span> is unable to
experience pressure of any kind anymore, mentally. He’s beyond pressure,
nothing can pressure him.
