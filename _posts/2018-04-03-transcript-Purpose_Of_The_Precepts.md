**Q:** What is the purpose of the precepts?

**Nm:** The purpose is for developing strength of mind and the first
step for achieving that is to be able to say “no” to yourself. To say
“no” to your desires, whims, habits and addictions. The main rules on
which the practice is based are very practical and necessary. They are
not supposed to be held because of a belief or because an authority
tells you to, they are kept because they hold, in themselves, the
practice of meditation - the development of mind. Think of the precepts
as a fertile ground where you can plant seeds in order to grow fruit
trees. They are not the tree or the seed, but having a grown tree would
be impossible without that fertile ground existing. In that sense, you
can see the necessity of the fertile ground being present, you can see
the necessity of the precepts. Without them, there is no point in you
watering seeds, when you have destroyed the fertility of the ground,
when you have compromised the fundamental precepts.

**Q:** What are you trying to grow?

**Nm:** You are trying to grow your freedom of mind because it is bound
by craving, it is liable to feelings. Which means when pain arises you
won’t be able to not resist it, when pleasure arises you won’t be able
but to indulge it. In other words, you are controlled by what you feel
and you are controlled because the mind is too weak in regard to what it
feels. So if you want to become stronger than all of those things, then
the first step to develop that strength is restraint, the ability to say
“no”, not to everything forever, but to certain things which are
unwholesome.

**Q:** Could you explain the precept in regard to eating?

**Nm:** You eat because it is necessary for the body to live, and not
for sensual reasons or escape from boredom, i.e. eating whatever and
whenever. You should recognise the necessity of eating and that’s what
you keep in mind, if you eat enough calories once a day, that is
sufficient, there is no good reason to eat more. Eating more than you
need is a form of sensuality, it comes from craving.

**Q:** But in the evening you could suffer from hunger.

**Nm:** It’s not a life threatening hunger. In the evening, if you have
eaten enough calories in the morning, you have the desire to eat and
instead of habitually just giving in to desire and trying to satisfy it
by any means, you instead force yourself to restrain and reflect on it:
“Ok, why am I pulled by this desire, why is this hunger controlling my
mind? Am I really hungry or am I just bored? Does the sensation of an
empty stomach mean that I have to eat?”. Through correct contemplation
and restraint you will get to understand where the problem is.

**Q:** If I eat a meal at night, then I will be free from that desire.

**Nm:** No you won’t. You will be free from hunger, but hunger was not
your desire. Yes, there would have been no desire without hunger but
hunger is not the desire. Desire is always mental. So when physical
hunger affects and controls your mind, then it becomes a desire, which
means you might go and remove the physical state but the liability of
your mind to be controlled by the physical state remains. Which means
that when the next physical thing comes, you will equally be bound by
the same desire, hence you can’t satisfy your desire and everybody knows
that. You can be choosing and engaging in all sorts of sensuality, but
you cannot satisfy that desire because it’s not there where you are
trying to satisfy it. You are appeasing/satisfying physical
circumstances, but those are not what the desire is. Yes, desire is
inseparable from those things but it’s not those things.

The precepts are basically putting up a boundary fence, making the soil
fertile so that you can practice. All the precepts are quite practical.
In the beginning the monks were allowed to eat in the evening, they
could eat throughout the day but then it became impractical for various
reasons, going out at night, facing all sorts of dangers, etc. So then a
rule was formulated to eat only at the right time, i.e. you don’t go out
at night to collect food but only in the morning. It became more
practical, and you don’t spend the rest of your day planning and being
concerned about food, but rather you spend it practising restraint,
composure and wisdom.

The eight precepts is what defines a fertile field that is not
negotiable. For example, how can you possibly be developing clarity and
strength of mind, when you are drinking alcohol that’s clearly directly
affecting your clarity of mind. You need to eat some food but you don’t
need to drink alcohol, hence it’s always going to be done for sensual
reasons. Even when people say that they only drink socially or that
people around them pressure them to do so, that’s also a sensual reason,
because you are basically afraid of adversely affecting your sensual
environment. You don’t want to upset anyone or be shunned by your social
group. That’s quite ridiculous especially if you are trying to develop
the strength of mind. How can that be developed if you give in to minor
weaknesses or are moved because people laugh and tease you for not
drinking. So what? How can you go beyond suffering, when just by someone
teasing you, you cannot maintain your virtuous behaviour.

**Q:** The precepts are not the only work that one must do.

**Nm:** The eight precepts are the necessary fertile field which is the
basis for starting the work. You can have all the fertile ground that
you want but if you don’t have the correct seeds and if you don’t put
the work in maintaining the soil, they are not going to grow. The soil
will not do the work for you, it’s just the soil..
