<p>“The Blessed One said,”Monks, do you develop mindfulness/recollection
of in-&amp;-out breathing?” When this was said, Ven. Arittha replied to
the Blessed One, “I develop mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing,
lord.”</p>
<p>“But how do you develop mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing,
Arittha?”</p>
<p>“Having abandoned sensual desire for past sensual pleasures, having
done away with sensual desire for future sensual pleasures, and having
thoroughly subdued perceptions of irritation/aversion/resistance
(paṭighasaññā) with regard to internal &amp; external events, I breathe
in mindfully and breathe out mindfully.”</p>
<p>“There is that mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing, Arittha. I
don’t say that there isn’t. But as to how mindfulness of in-&amp;-out
breathing is brought in detail to its culmination, listen and pay close
attention. I will speak…”</p>
<p>…The Blessed One said, “And how, Arittha, is mindfulness of
in-&amp;-out breathing brought in detail to its culmination? There is
the case where a monk, having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a
tree, or to an empty building, sits down folding his legs crosswise,
holding his body upright, and bringing recollection to the fore. Always
recollected, he breathes in; recollected he breathes out.</p>
<p>“Breathing in long, he discerns, ‘I am breathing in long’; or
breathing out long, he discerns, ‘I am breathing out long.’…”</p>

<p>Some might think that what Arittha described is not correct
mindfulness of breathing but the Buddha didn’t disagree with him and
then offered a <em>different</em> practice. On the contrary, he
acknowledged it but then added that his practice is not complete. Then
he went to describe how to develop Ven Arittha’s mindfulness of
breathing to fulfilment. Arittha’s practice was enough for freedom from
sensuality, which he claimed, and the Buddha didn’t dispute. However, it
was not enough for final liberation and uprooting of all conceit. So if
you practice that mindfulness of breathing in that simply sense that he
described, which is by the way how every anapanasati instruction begins:
“Recollected he breathes in, Recollected he breathes out”, that’s all
you need to know and if you stick to that as the Ven.Arittha did you
will overcome any desire towards sensual objects of the present, past
and future. In other words, you would have surmounted the entire domain
of sensual craving and most importantly you would have completely
subdued that <em>patigha</em> towards your own senses. Which is enough
for having the five lower fetters destroyed.</p>
<p>Mindfulness of breathing is often taken as a mechanical method, and
so to avoid that mistake, it would be better to first follow
Ven.Arritha’s instructions because it would prevent you from falling
into a mindless ‘in-and-out-breathing-focussing-visualisation’
technique. It would force you to develop knowledge of the enduring
breath underneath your experience, regardless of the mental, emotional,
or physical state. (That’s also how <em>anapanasati</em> brings
<em>satipatthana</em> to fulfilment.) As the Suttas say, recollected he
breathes in or out. They don’t say “<em>focused</em>” or
“<em>concentrated</em>” he breathes in or out.</p>
<p>If you overcome all sensuality and subdue all of the <em>patigha</em>
that you have towards your own senses and towards anything or anyone in
the world, present, past or future, then you will be ready to follow the
Buddha’s detailed instructions on <em>anapanasati</em>. You will also
know exactly what he means, otherwise, you will be doing his
instructions with sensuality and as a method that you think will result
in a “Greater sensual pleasure for me!”. Any greatness of mindfulness of
breathing can only be developed upon complete surmounting of sensuality
or overcoming the five lower fetters.</p>
<p>That breath underneath your experience that is always enduring and
which you don’t lose sight of (the knowledge of the breath being there),
is an anchor for mindfulness. You can focus on that physical side if you
want but you must first know that the breathing is underneath you,
that’s really what the anchor is. Using the enduring breath that’s
already there happening to you, underneath your emotional state, etc, as
an anchor for mindfulness and then investing effort into not losing
sight of that peripherally. You don’t need to stop doing what you are
doing in order to breathe, but you can certainly not allow yourself to
be absorbed into what you’re doing, so that you forget that breathing is
happening in the background. It’s about learning how not to overly
commit to the foreground attention and learning how to stretch your mind
to discern ‘both ends’ (background and foreground) simultaneously
enduring. That’s why, when you develop <em>samadhi</em>/composure, the
mind becomes pliable, it can stretch, it’s no longer a hard twisted
lump.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Having become accomplished in virtue and sense
restraint, things calm down and then the reality of the body becomes
clearer.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> That reality of the body will first present
itself as unpleasant and confining because you will experience the
fundamental <em>patigha</em> that you have towards it, you are going to
experience this physical resistance, sickness, like a heroin addict
going through withdrawal because you’re withdrawing from the entire
domain of ‘sensual being’ (<em>kamabhava</em>). However, you have to
abandon that <em>patigha</em>/aversion, that aversion towards your own
senses which are no longer engaging with sensual distractions. That’s
why the sensual desire is so powerful because the aversion towards being
confined within the body underneath it is extremely strong and the only
means of escape, that an ordinary person knows, is sensual pleasure,
which is no escape at all.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> In a way, that’s the first thing you do as you
are born, your first act is to try and escape that fundamental
discomfort. Your senses are agitated and you don’t want that pain and so
you automatically reach away from that and into the direction of sensual
objects.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> That’s what is meant by ‘underlying tendencies’.
The baby is not doing anything but the mind is paired with the senses
and they are uncomfortable, however subtle it may be. There is nothing
else there except that discomfort for a newborn mind and what an
unenlightened mind does, regardless of the type of discomfort it is
experiencing, is it wants to get rid of it. So naturally on that
fundamental level when the baby is experiencing the discomfort of its
new born body/senses, it naturally goes in the direction of sense
objects. Not that it chooses to but the discomfort pushes it in that
direction and then everything else it starts encountering in the world,
the mother, breastfeeding, etc, just becomes a confirmation of that
direction where it found relative safety from this discomfort which
itself is, this unsafety of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> By knowing the sense organs for what they are,
means that you experience them as uncomfortable, pressured and
agitated.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes, practically speaking, you will experience
them as a pressure. However there is only pressure when you have
ignorance, which the baby does, it has an underlying tendency of
<em>avijja</em>. If there was no <em>avijja</em> in that baby’s mind, it
would not have been born. If you begin to know and see the sense organs
clearly and sustain that clarity, you will begin to diminish your
ignorance in regards to them, your appropriation of them, your
assumption of ownership. You will get to understand that resisting them
is futile and therefore your aversion will also fade.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The body is fundamentally agitated.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> The nature of form/<em>rupa</em> is to deform,
the elements which it is made up of are changing and reshaping and your
body is doing the same.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> You cannot just remove that bodily discomfort
because that is the body. You have to somehow make peace with it.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> By removing your aversion towards the senses,
that’s how you make peace. You subdue all perceptions of
<em>patigha</em> by thoroughly developing sense restraint, keeping a
close eye on them so that they don’t get polluted by the
unwholesome.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If you had to suppress the body, trying to not
let it sense anything, it would just get more agitated.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> If you want to calm down these wild animals,
these untamed sense organs, you can’t just give them what they want and
you certainly won’t calm them down by beating and starving them either.
You need to give them the right kind of food when needed and not too
much.</p>
