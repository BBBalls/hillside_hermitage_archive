**Q:** This is in regards to Ven. Nanavira\'s, shorter notes on ​anicca​
and the sutta quotes found there :

> **\"In the Khandha Samyutta (iv,6 \<S.iii,38\>) it is said of rūpa,
> vedanā, saññā, sankhārā, and viññāna: uppādo paññāyati; vayo
> paññāyati; thitassa aññathattam paññāyati. (\'Arising (appearance) is
> manifest; disappearance is manifest; change while standing is
> manifest\...\"**

It seems at first glance, one would think that the order would be
different, that it would be \"arising, then changing while standing, and
then ceasing\". Is there a reason why it isn\'t in that particular
order?

**Nm:** Because that order is rooted in a wrong view of the external
point of view in regards to the experience, in regards to the
fundamentals of space and time. People assume the external world, which
is independent of me and my experience, and that external world
possesses time in which we are placed, so to speak. So, \'time\', stands
for that external assumption of yourself. You think that you have arisen
and you\'re enduring and then you\'re ceasing, but that requires an
external reference point to see that kind of flow, which is actually
impossible to see because you can\'t step outside of yourself. You can
have that notion of a flow, or of flux in regards to external things
around you, in regard to objects of your senses, but you cannot have
that kind of reference point in regards to your own senses. That\'s why
it can only be described and seen internally, phenomenologically, which
is how the Buddha described it, \"arising is manifest, or disappearing
is manifest, or changing while standing is manifest\". If you look at
the nature of arising, it\'s like fading in, which means there is no
first point before which thing wasn\'t and then it is, as though you can
catch the moment where it appeared, that\'s impossible, that can only be
done in an external manner. But when you\'re trying to apply to your own
situation, and the senses, the sense bases, you cannot see it like that.

If you look at it, you see that it\'s either already fading in or fading
out. Doesn\'t matter which, it is persisting while changing or changing
while standing. Why? Because if you have something \'fading in\', it
means it\'s increasing in its presence, which means it\'s staying the
same thing while it\'s increasing its presence. And that\'s just another
way of saying it\'s \'changing while remaining the same\'. If something
is fading out, as in, it\'s de-intensifying in its presence. Again, it
stays the same thing, you can still designate it as the same thing,
while it\'s changing as in \'fading out\'. So whether it\'s arising or
disappearing, you can say that it\'s persisting while changing, just in
a different direction.

That\'s why the Buddha described it in that order: ​*\"arising is
manifest, ceasing is manifest, persisting while changing is
manifest\"*,​ the three ways of looking at an arisen phenomena, either
intensifying or de-intensifying, which, either way, is to see it as
changing while remaining the same.

**Q:** What\'s often heard in meditation instructions, is this idea of
having to watch things constantly change, and or trying to capture
nanosecond changes so that you can have an insight etc.

**Nm:** Yes, it\'s unfortunate but not surprising. The external point of
view of ourselves is one of the fundamental wrong views that can be
manifested. It can manifest itself in different ways but contemporarily,
the most common way is the scientific outlook. As in you see yourself
inhabiting this public world, that is there before you and it\'s going
to carry on after you, But any notions of the world that you can have,
it\'s based on your experience as a whole and your sense bases. Thus,
you having a view that it\'s independent of *\"​that because of
which​\"* that view is there in the first place, that\'s why it\'s a
wrong view.

Any notion of flux requires a non-changing reference point. So, you can
see things are flowing against THIS. And you can do that in regards to
your sense objects. But you cannot do that in regard to your sense
bases, as in, you cannot step outside of the five aggregates and your
situation as a whole and then see it constantly changing or even worse,
measure the nano fractions of it. That\'s unthinkable. But you can come
up with a pleasing theory and a very neat description of it. But that
would require a person to inhabit the wrong view of the external world
in regards to himself and then everything will make sense. But because
it\'s rooted in that misperception of the fundamental aspects of your
situation, it cannot result in any knowledge or wisdom.

**Q:** He writes shortly after:

> **\"These three sankhatassa sankhatalakkhanāni (Anguttara III,v,7
> \<A.i,152\>), or characteristics whereby what is determined (i.e. a
> sankhata dhamma) may be known as such (i.e. as sankhata), concisely
> indicate the fundamental structure in virtue of which things are
> things---in virtue of which, that is to say, things are distinct, one
> from another. It is also in virtue of this structure that all
> experience, including the arahat\'s, is intentional (see CETANĀ) or
> teleological (i.e. that things are significant, that they point to
> other, possible, things\...\"**

**Nm:** \"Changing while remaining the same,\" requires at least two
different levels of that generality, requires a certain sameness while
within that, simultaneously present to that sameness, that thing is
changing, until it\'s changed to such a degree that then abruptly you
just see how it\'s a different thing present there, as in your
experience has changed. So, that in itself is already intentional. The
things on the lower level of generality, that\'s why he talks about the
fundamental structure, are bound by that general determination of
\'still being the same thing\'. When that changes to a greater degree
that determination ceases. And that\'s the basis of any intentionality.
That\'s the basis of any choices you can make. The possibilities that
are implied in the given experience as a whole, are within that
experience as a whole. And in return, they actually determined that
experience as a whole for how you know it.
