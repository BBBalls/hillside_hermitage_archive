When you ask "How do I let go?", do you ask that question when you are
at the peak of happiness and when life is comfortable? Do you ask how to
let go of that pleasure or excitement? No. That question is always asked
when there\'s something bothering you, when you're overwhelmed, when
something that you do not want is not going away, when you can\'t help
but keep revolving around something that\'s unpleasant. That\'s when you
want to know how to let go.

However, you have to stop trying to get rid of that suffering because
*letting go* entails developing wisdom in regard to the nature of not
being able to hold things in the first place. If you were truly
*holding* the loved one, they would not have passed, they would not have
changed, you would not have been experiencing suffering, you would have
been in control.

> But because form is non-self, form leads to affliction, and it is not
> possible to control form: 'Let my form be thus; let my form not be
> thus.'
>
> \"Feeling is non-self.... ... Perception is non-self.... Intentions
> are non-self.... Consciousness is non-self. For if, bhikkhus,
> consciousness were self, this consciousness would not lead to
> affliction, and it would be possible to control consciousness: 'Let my
> consciousness be thus; let my consciousness not be thus.' But because
> consciousness is non-self, consciousness leads to affliction, and it
> is not possible to control consciousness: 'Let my consciousness be
> thus; let my consciousness not be thus.\"

When things are comfortable, people don\'t want to look at the nature of
change or contemplate letting go.

When things are happy and bright. They fully develop a belief that they
are in control of what they own, what they possess, who they love, who
they are. But then when things change, as you know they will but you
have been ignoring that fact, NOW you want to let go. But real y now you
just want to not suffer the painful consequences which are the result of
you holding on.

It\'s also not a question of never engaging with the world because
things will change. It\'s about never losing perspective, in regard to
that which is subject to change, which is everything around you,
including yourself.

In other words, letting go is not something you do. Letting go is
understanding that you could not have held things in the first place.

> \"...Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu is practising in this way---'It could not

> Whatever there is, whatever exists---I abandon that'. In this way he
> obtains equanimity. He does not delight in that equanimity, he
> doesn\'t welcome it, doesn\'t keep holding on to it. For him, not
> delighting in that equanimity, not welcoming it, not holding onto it,
> consciousness is not dependent on it, he doesn\'t assume it. Ānanda, a

Don\'t just reflect on letting go when there is discomfort or when there
is pain, or when there is reminder of it, but do it at the peak of your
happiness. When everything is ne, everything is going your way, be aware
that it could have not been that way and it won\'t be that way. That
reflection and remembrance can result in a slight uneasiness, but that
is the gateway to that right perspective of recognising the true meaning
of *anicca* that the Buddha spoke about. *Anicca* means "subject to
change", it doesn\'t mean "changing al the time", it means "subject to
change, against your will , outside of your scope of your control, you
are subject to it".

Understanding *anicca*, understanding "being subject to change" means
letting go, it means preventing yourself from assuming that you are
holding on.

Often you will get given advice to just let go, but "just let go" is not
a matter of choice. Even *holding* is not a matter of choice. It\'s the
result of whether you have perspective in regard to what is subject to
change or if you\'re ignoring that. If you\'re ignoring the nature that
things are subject to change, that things are fundamental y not in your
control, then you\'re "holding", even if you don\'t think "I will hold
this dearly", you are already making something dear to you and you\'re
holding it blindly. If you\'re not ignoring that things are subject to
change, if you\'re consciously making an effort \"Oh look, this is my
dog, my pet I had it my whole life, his life can end, my life can end,
that\'s the most natural thing. But I don\'t want to think about it only
when it happens, and now pretend that it will never happen, and just
laugh it o and change the subject. Such an attitude means I am ignoring
the basic, crude, obvious reality of things being subjected to change,
that is against my will , and because of that I\'m holding on to things,
not because I look after the dog.

Just because I feed it doesn\'t mean I\'m attached. No. Only if I DO NOT
have perspective in regard to the dog being subject to change, or myself
being subject to change, then that\'s how I\'m holding, that\'s how I\'m
attached\". Likewise with family, possessions, wealth, health, things
you take for granted. You take them for granted by ignoring that they
are subject to change, because it\'s disconcerting to think about it.
You think you can avoid it by ignoring it, but then you pay the price
when they change and you're affected, and then you want to let go. But
that\'s just the result of everything else you\'ve been holding wrongly
before.

"How do I let go?", should be reformulated as \"How do I not lose
perspective in regard to that which I hold dearly and is subject to
change?

Well, by making an effort to think about these things, rightly, even if
you have to set some time aside everyday, like half an hour and just
contemplate how things are subject to change. When you are doing such a
contemplation, if you feel anxious, al ow that feeling to manifest,
because that is the feeling of the world that you\'re in. That anxiety
is the result of recognising the true nature of things, and initial y,
that\'s not going to be pleasant to the mind which up to that point, has
been making all the effort to ignore the nature of change. If somebody
is asking the question, "How to let go?" That means at least to that
extent, they have some sort of recognition of their responsibility in
their own suffering.

The suffering you\'re experiencing on account of not letting go is the
result of an underlying problem of ignoring that things are subject to
change. You don\'t admit that to yourself enough, you never let that
sink in deep enough, because it\'s felt unpleasantly. As simple as that.
Therefore, you can start letting go by admitting these things to
yourself, by contemplating it, and by enduring the unpleasantness of it
when it arises. You can realise that you have a choice, you\'re either
going to endure those mild anxieties and concerns on account of the
realisation that, "Yes, things will change and I will not ignore this".
Or you\'re going to pretend it\'s not there, and then be completely
crushed, when things do change against your will . That\'s when you will
be asking, "How do I let go?". You might even lose your mind with grief
and so on. So don\'t wait for that to prompt you to think about letting
go. Don\'t wait until it\'s too late.

You can let go or become detached by seeing that you could not have been
attached to it in the first place, and the only way to see that is to
contemplate that. It will prevent you from being attached the way you
are.

You cannot be attached to your pets or a loved one or possessions, if
you don\'t forget they can be taken away at any given second, and the
fact that that is a possibility, means they were never yours to begin
with, no matter how long you have been attached to them, no matter how
deeply you have loved them. It doesn\'t matter what you do, this is the
ultimate context, "THIS is subject to change, it\'s against my will",
that\'s *anicca*. Mindfulness of that context is worth developing
because it leads to true freedom.

If you do make the effort and sustain the perspective that, "My dear pet
can be taken away at any given time". That perspective will prevent you
from becoming blindly, carelessly, obliviously attached to it. And when
things change, there will not be as much of a shock to the system,
because you know beforehand that it is truly out of your hands. So the
grief will be seriously dampened, and if you\'ve truly developed a full
understanding of *anicca*, there will be no grief at all. Even for
people who are not monks or who are not committed to this practice 24/7,
it\'s still a useful thing to be aware of, the fact that things are
subject to change. It\'s quite a useful superpower that you can develop
in this life. It keeps you more resilient, more patient, more stable,
more impermeable to disruptions, because sometimes things might change
quickly into one thing and then into another, from very pleasant, to
intensely unpleasant, and you will still be able to sustain some sort of
composure in regard to it, which most people would not. Which means your
well being, your contentment will be less affected, even as an undevoted
practitioner.

It\'s always useful to have that authentic recognition of "things are
subject to change". But it needs to be done on that personal level.
Usual y when a person hears about *anicca*, it\'s often taken in this
abstract sense,

"Yes, everything is subject to change. Modern science has shown
everything is constantly changing, etc".

People tend to think about *anicca* in those completely impersonal
terms, but that\'s not *anicca*. *Anicca* is finding that which is dear
to you, and contemplating that to be subject to change, and then see how
indifferent you\'re going to stay if you start thinking like that. If
you work through that unease on account of contemplating the loss of
that which is personal y dear to you, that\'s where freedom from
suffering canbe found. The letting go that comes from understanding the
nature of things is how you will not suffer even when your dearest
family members, pets, friends, or whatever, change, die or leave. Your
mind will not be affected. That doesn\'t mean that you will not perceive
what has happened or not know the significance of an event, it just
means you will not be as affected by it because you never lost
perspective in regards to that which is inevitable- sickness, old age
and death.
