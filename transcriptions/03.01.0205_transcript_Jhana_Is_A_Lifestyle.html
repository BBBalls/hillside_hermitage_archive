<p><em>“Jhana is an establishment of mind that results from your own
efforts of purifying your lifestyle. It’s not a magical experience that
will purify your life for you. Jhana is one of the last positive
symptoms of you healing the wounds of lust, hatred and
ignorance.”</em></p>
<p><cite>MN 107 - The Discourse to Ganaka-Moggallana</cite>:</p>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<p>“…When the Tathāgata gets a person fit to be tamed, he first trains
him thus: ‘(1)Come, bhikkhu. Be virtuous. Dwell restrained in accordance
with the Pāṭimokkha, consummate in your behavior &amp; sphere of
activity. Train yourself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing
danger in the slightest faults.’</p>
<p>“When the monk is virtuous… seeing danger in the slightest faults,
the Tathāgata then trains him further: ‘(2)Come, monk. Be one who is
guarded in the doors of your sense faculties. On seeing a form with the
eye, don’t grasp at any signs and features (significance) by which—if
you were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye—evil,
unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail you.
Practice for its restraint. Protect the faculty of the eye. Attain
restraint with regard to the faculty of the eye. On hearing a sound with
the ear…. On smelling an aroma with the nose…. On tasting a flavor with
the tongue…. On touching a tactile sensation with the body…. On
cognizing an idea with the intellect, don’t grasp at any signs and
features by which—if you were to dwell without restraint over the
faculty of the intellect—evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or
distress might assail you. Practice for its restraint. Protect the
faculty of the intellect. Attain restraint with regard to the faculty of
the intellect.’</p>
<p>“When the monk is one who is guarded in the doors of his sense
faculties… the Tathāgata then trains him further: ‘(3)Come, monk. Be one
who is moderate in eating. With a correct perspective
(yonisomanasikara), take your food not playfully, nor for intoxication,
nor for putting on bulk, nor for beautification, but simply for the
survival &amp; continuance of this body, for ending its afflictions, for
the support of the holy life, thinking, “I will destroy old feelings
&amp; not create new feelings. Thus I will maintain myself, be
blameless, &amp; live in comfort.”’</p>
<p>“When the monk is one who is moderate in eating… the Tathāgata then
trains him further: ‘(4)Come, monk. Be one who is devoted to
wakefulness. During the day, sitting &amp; walking back &amp; forth,
cleanse your mind of any obstructive states. During the first watch of
the night [dusk to 10 p.m.], sitting &amp; walking back &amp; forth,
cleanse your mind of any obstructive states. During the second watch of
the night [10 p.m. to 2 a.m.], reclining on your right side, take up the
lion’s posture, one foot placed on top of the other, mindful, alert,
with your mind set on getting up [either as soon as you awaken or at a
particular time]. During the last watch of the night [2 a.m. to dawn],
sitting &amp; walking back &amp; forth, cleanse your mind of any
obstructive states.’</p>
<p>“When the monk is one who is devoted to wakefulness/vigilance… the
Tathāgata then trains him further: ‘(5)Come, monk. Be one who is
possessed of mindfulness &amp; awareness. When going forward &amp;
returning, make yourself aware. When looking toward &amp; looking away….
When bending &amp; extending your limbs…. When carrying your outer
cloak, upper robe, &amp; bowl…. When eating, drinking, chewing, &amp;
tasting…. When urinating &amp; defecating…. When walking, standing,
sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, &amp; remaining silent,
make yourself aware.’</p>
<p>“When the monk is one who is possessed of mindfulness &amp;
awareness… The Tathāgata then trains him further: ‘(6)Come, monk. Seek
out a secluded dwelling: a wilderness, the shade of a tree, a mountain,
a glen, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a forest grove, the open air,
a heap of straw.’”He seeks out a secluded dwelling: a wilderness, the
shade of a tree, a mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a charnel ground,
a forest grove, the open air, a heap of straw. After his meal, returning
from his alms round, he sits down, crosses his legs, holds his body
upright, and brings mindfulness to the fore.</p>
<p>“(7)Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world, he dwells with
an awareness devoid of covetousness. He cleanses his mind of
covetousness. Abandoning ill will &amp; anger, he dwells with an
awareness devoid of ill will, sympathetic to the welfare of all living
beings. He cleanses his mind of ill will &amp; anger. Abandoning sloth
&amp; drowsiness, he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth &amp;
drowsiness, mindful, alert, percipient of light. He cleanses his mind of
sloth &amp; drowsiness. Abandoning restlessness &amp; anxiety, he dwells
undisturbed, his mind inwardly stilled. He cleanses his mind of
restlessness &amp; anxiety. Abandoning uncertainty, he dwells having
crossed over uncertainty, with no perplexity with regard to skillful
qualities. He cleanses his mind of uncertainty.</p>
<p>“(8)Having abandoned these five hindrances—imperfections of awareness
that weaken discernment—then, quite secluded from sensuality, secluded
from unskillful qualities, he enters &amp; remains in the first jhāna:
joy &amp; pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought &amp;
evaluation… the second jhāna…the third jhāna, the fourth jhāna: purity
of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain.</p>
<p>“This is my instruction, brahman, to those monks in training who have
not attained the goal but remain intent on the unsurpassed safety from
bondage. But for those monks who are arahants—whose defilements are
ended, who have reached fulfillment, done the task, laid down the
burden, attained the true goal, laid to waste the fetter of being, and
who are released through right understanding—these qualities lead both
to a pleasant abiding in the here &amp; now, and to mindfulness and
awareness.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> When it says “be restrained by the patimokkha”,
we can boil that down to the eight or ten precepts and exclude the other
rules which were pertaining to social circumstances at the time, so it’s
not just for monastics, even if you do not wear robes, if you want to
practice then the rules of patimokkha apply to you, not technically but
in the spirit of the eight precepts. That’s why when the Buddha would
speak about virtue in the context outside of the monastic sangha, he
would speak about the eight precepts, which is the bare minimum for the
beginning of that self-taming restraint. The five precepts keep you from
behaving like an animal and you make merit which will contribute to a
better birth and so on. But if you are the one who sees himself as one
who practices the Dhamma, then you know that the eight precepts are not
negotiable, that is the bare minimum. So you can substitute the sentence
“come bhikkhu…” with “if you want to practice, ok, come here/follow me,
this is the discipline that you must take on, and once you have taken it
on, you need to start seeing the danger in the slightest fault.”</p>
<p>Now that can initially be taken neurotically, but that’s ok, you will
get used to the neurotic aspect of it, but still remain seeing the value
of the discipline and the fear of breaking it. So in a way, if you are
neurotic about breaking the precepts, that fear will actually protect
your discipline. You are afraid of it because you know that it will undo
your striving. Things that you want to develop through your practice can
only be developed on the basis of discipline, so by reflecting on that
danger you will be afraid of doing it and that’s why you won’t be
careless about it. If you are not afraid about breaking the precepts,
that’s when you become careless because there is no fear of wrongdoing
motivating you.</p>
<p>The common misconception, even with people who keep the precepts, who
see the direct value of it, they don’t see how it is helping them to
tame themselves, they then keep the precepts out of faith, culture,
tradition or whatever meditation group they are a part of, they might
keep the rules on account of external circumstances motivating them to
be restrained, but deep down they still hold a view that all these
random things they do will somehow magically contribute to an experience
of a jhana or enlightenment which will mean that they have no more work
to do. In other words they don’t see a direct link between what they can
do through their own choices and development of the right context which
will inevitably have to result in jhana and enlightenment, they just do
RANDOM work which they HOPE will produce the experience of jhana or
enlightenment.</p>
<p>The second part of the gradual training is guarding the senses.
That’s what peripheral awareness is, the non-grasping of signs and
features of that which is seen (etc), it’s not like you don’t see
anything. The signs and features of a sense object that you experience
are always peripheral, you don’t see signs and features. For example
when you look at a sign which says “Stop”, you see the letters, the
color and shape, but the significance of “You must not pass beyond this
point, you must stop there”, that is not in the sign, yet you experience
that when your eyes see the sign, those are the features of that sign,
the significance of it. The reason I’m saying this, is because often
that practice of sense restraint is conflated with a view that one must
beat the senses down, by not looking, not hearing and so on, but even if
you do that, you still won’t see the significance of that, the signs and
features of what you’re doing, and that’s where you need to start
recognising the sense restraint to be.</p>
<p>When you are restraining/taming the senses you know before you do any
action whether that act will be rooted in greed, aversion or
distraction. But now let’s say things surprise you, a sensual option
arises and pressures you, then you have a choice to dwell mentally on
the signs and features that are suitable for the increasing of passion
or dispassion, both things are there, you must choose to attend to
either one. Either way, pressure has arisen and you cannot undo that,
you have seen something. You realize that you are only relatively in
control of the senses, you can try avoid certain sights but still things
can happen because the organs are still there untamed and when that does
happen, you need to allow things to endure without breaking the
discipline, that’s the order and that’s why you have the discipline
first.</p>
<p>If you were to be restraining your senses correctly, it’s effortless.
You don’t need to be beating your eye down, cutting your ears off, etc,
so that you never experience objects that might cause the pressure of
lust or disagreeability to arise in you. All you need to do is to make
sure that when your eyes do see, or when your ears do hear, you don’t
delight, accept, welcome, entertain the signs and features that are
making lust increase, like the sign of beauty, the sign of
non-agreeability, the sign of non-danger, the sign of friendly and
non-threatening, all those significances are the signs of sensuality. If
people were to truly see the danger of sensuality, none of that would
ever again be seen as safe, friendly, suitable, pleasurable for me, it
would be seen like a pit of burning embers, a poisonous drink, etc.
Those significances are there, it’s not like you must remove the
significances of pleasures, no, you must stop entertaining them and look
for the other significances that are equally there that you have been
ignoring out of your habits of welcoming lust.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I can attend to the beautiful significance of an
object which will increase lust or I can look at non-beautiful
significance (asubhanimitta) which would calm things down.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> But not for the sake of getting rid of the
beautiful parts or for the sake of getting rid of the pressure, those
things are not yours. Your eye is pressured, and your eye wants the
beautiful parts. All you need to do is keep protecting the context of
the non-beautiful, the threatening and dangerous and keep it there, and
it will prevail because it is the fundamental context. That’s why the
Buddha would say, in beauty, if you develop your mind, you will be able
to see the ugly through it. Not change the beautiful and the ugly, it’s
still the same beautiful significances, but through them you see the
ugly, you see the danger.</p>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<p>“…And how, Ānanda, is one a noble one developing the faculties? Here,
Ānanda, in a bhikkhu having seen a form with the eye, there arises what
is pleasant, there arises what is unpleasant, there arises what is
pleasant and unpleasant. If he should wish: ‘May I remain perceiving the
unrepulsive in what is repulsive’, he remains there perceiving the
unrepulsive. If he should wish: ‘May I remain perceiving the repulsive
in what is unrepulsive’, he remains there perceiving the repulsive. If
he should wish: ‘May I remain perceiving the unrepulsive in what is
repulsive and what is unrepulsive’, he remains there perceiving the
unrepulsive. If he should wish: ‘May I remain perceiving the repulsive
in what is repulsive and what is unrepulsive’, he remains there
perceiving the repulsive. If he should wish: ‘May I, getting rid of both
what is repulsive and what is unrepulsive, remain equanimous, mindful
and aware’, he remains there equanimous, mindful and aware…”</p>
<p>— <cite>MN 152</cite></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Do not grasp the sign of beauty…</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Don’t take it up, dont welcome it or entertain
it. It’s there but you don’t take it up, and you won’t take it up, if
you start attending to the significances that you do not want to take
up, the significances of danger.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> So in a way, you should grasp the sign of
danger?</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes, you don’t start in a neutral sense, you
don’t start your practice whereby you have this equal choice of
beautiful and ugly, you begin by being fully gripped and pressured by
the beautiful. Your sense restraint begins by not doing that, so don’t
grasp those features and then the other features will become more
apparent and then by all means grasp the feature of ugly, stick to it
and it will develop dispassion all the way to final liberation. Those
beneficial features are not visible because of the automatic grasp of
lust - when you are touched by pleasure, the automatic grasp at getting
rid of the discomfort - when you are touched by pain and the automatic
grasp of distraction - when you are touched by
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. You guard your senses by
maintaining the context that will make you abstain from habitually
grasping onto the beautiful aspects of what is given, and that pertains
to any given sense.</p>
<p>You only need to abandon things which are underlied by lust, aversion
and delusion, don’t grasp at them, and the signs and features which are
revealed through non-grasping, you cannot grasp them in the same way,
means you cannot delight or lust after jhana, and that’s exactly how you
enter jhana by fully withdrawing yourself from signs and features that
are grasped with lust, for increasing of lust, ill will or ignorance. By
all means grasp the sign of ugly but you cannot grasp it with lust, you
can only grasp it with discernment. It is worth keeping in your mind
because it results in dispassion.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong></p>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<p>“When the monk is one who is guarded in the doors of his sense
faculties… the Tathāgata then trains him further: ’(3)Come, monk. Be one
who is moderate in eating. With a correct perspective (right context),
take your food not playfully, nor for intoxication, nor for putting on
bulk, nor for beautification, but simply for the survival &amp;
continuance of this body, for ending its afflictions, for the support of
the holy life, thinking,”I will destroy old feelings (of hunger) &amp;
not create new feelings (from overeating). Thus I will maintain myself,
be blameless, &amp; live in comfort.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> You need to then sustain the right motivation
for eating, it’s not optional. Don’t think that by eating half a meal it
constitutes being moderate, that’s basically asceticism and it’s often
misguided. You should be moderate in eating, not losing the context for
eating. How is that done? By not eating for the wrong reasons and eating
for the right reasons, and that motivation is something that you can
choose to keep in your mind or ignore. If you can keep that motivation
in mind, you don’t have to worry about overeating or under-eating. Often
moderation of eating gets conflated with some idea like: “I eat only 20%
of my meal”, but that just means that you are still ignorant of the
motivation behind your eating. Just because you reduce your enjoyment in
eating to 20%, does not mean that your sensuality is not there. If there
is any form of passion in regard to food that means you are not eating
for the right reasons, which means you need to be contemplating and
discerning those reasons more clearly, not just try not to eat less and
less, which is what a lot of people try to do. Don’t eat it if you don’t
need to, but don’t not eat it just because you don’t know where your
motivation is rooted. The practice is about discerning your motivation
and re-rooting it in wholesomeness.</p>
<p>You begin by eating out of sensuality, for beautification, for
entertainment, you don’t start eating with a clear mind, but if you eat
just to remove the hunger, you will get to see what a burden and a chore
eating is. If you sustain that correct context then all the previous
wrong reasons will disappear.</p>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<p>“…Just as, Ānanda, a strong man would let two or three drops of water
fall onto an iron pan heated all day: slow, Ānanda, would be the falling
the drops of water, but then they would quickly vanish and disappear;
just so, Ānanda, whatever it is, thus quickly, thus rapidly, thus
easily, the arisen pleasant [thing], the arisen unpleasant [thing], the
arisen pleasant and unpleasant [thing] ceases, and upekkhā is
established: this is called, Ānanda, the unsurpassed development of the
faculties in a noble one’s vinaya, as regards to mental phenomena
cognizable by the mind. Such, Ānanda, is the unsurpassed development of
the faculties in a noble one’s vinaya…”</p>
<p>— <cite>MN 152</cite></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>You don’t have to try and micro-manage your meals because trying to
control those external circumstances won’t uproot your greed because it
is not in the food. All you need to do is sustain the correct context,
heat up the iron pan, and your previous wrong reasons for eating will
diminish.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong></p>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<p>“When the monk is one who is moderate in eating… the Tathāgata then
trains him further: ‘(4)Come, monk. Be one who is devoted to
wakefulness. During the day, sitting &amp; walking back &amp; forth,
cleanse your mind of any obstructive states. During the first watch of
the night [dusk to 10 p.m.], sitting &amp; walking back &amp; forth,
cleanse your mind of any obstructive states. During the second watch of
the night [10 p.m. to 2 a.m.], reclining on your right side, take up the
lion’s posture, one foot placed on top of the other, mindful, alert,
with your mind set on getting up [either as soon as you awaken or at a
particular time]. During the last watch of the night [2 a.m. to dawn],
sitting &amp; walking back &amp; forth, cleanse your mind of any
obstructive states.’</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> How many contemporary teachings teach how to
purify your mind from obstructive states? Most of the instructions just
tell you to focus on an object, but how is that purifying your mind? A
person does these techniques hoping that no obstructive states will
arise, but they are not purifying it. You cannot just start cleansing
your mind because you do not start out even seeing your mind, let alone
states which are obstructive for the mind. You need to first be well
restrained with the discipline, celibate, seeing the danger in the
slightest fault, not entertaining the signs and features that would be
increasing hindrances, then be moderate in eating, having that clarity
of motivation behind eating, because for most people that is completely
invisible. Most people don’t keep precepts or practice celibacy, most
people live with a mind wet with sensuality and don’t guard their
senses, they don’t even see the signs and features of the mind. When
they hear about guarding the sense faculties, they think that they must
not see or hear anything. They don’t try to discipline their senses,
they try to kill them. But if you do all the things that we just
discussed, then you will have clarity of mind, which is protected
through guarding the senses, you will discern the gateway where
non-arisen unwholesome states can enter.</p>
<p>Being watchful of your actions throughout the day means that your
mind is staying with that which is the priority, which is ‘the guarding
of the gateway’ of your mind, so that there are no obstructions for it.
That’s the sole task you have which can be outlined through discipline,
guarding the senses and being moderate in eating. You will end up just
having to guard the entrance of the gateway, you don’t have to be
running around. The gateway is that one entrance into the city which is
walled all round. That wall is your discipline and sense restraint.
That’s why sila and celibacy is not optional if you want to
practice.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong></p>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<p>“When the monk is one who is devoted to wakefulness… the Tathāgata
then trains him further: ’(5)Come, monk. Be one who is possessed of
mindfulness &amp; awareness. When going forward &amp; returning, make
yourself aware. When looking toward &amp; looking away…. When bending
&amp; extending your limbs…. When carrying your outer cloak, upper robe,
&amp; bowl…. When eating, drinking, chewing, &amp; tasting…. When
urinating &amp; defecating…. When walking, standing, sitting, falling
asleep, waking up, talking, &amp; remaining silent, make yourself
aware.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> To compose that previous wakefulness/vigilance
even further, one needs to bring that context of wakefulness that you
have developed, ‘the guard post’, and intensify it. You don’t need to be
doing that in some formal hour of focusing meditation, but rather it’s
done whether you are going to the toilet, extending your arm, laying
down, cleaning ,etc. So that even while you are doing all these tasks,
the guard post is clear and you are not abandoning that one job that you
have, which is to protect the mind from obstructive states.</p>
<p>Also, just notice at what stage in the training that the Buddha
presents this. I say this because many people try to start here,
thinking that by focusing on their hands or feet, they are doing
mindfulness and awareness. There is no ‘focusing’ in ‘mindfulness and
awareness’, it’s about developing the right context to an unshakeable
extent. It’s about being able to see the signs and features of your
mind, its inclinations and protect it from obstructive states before
they even arise. The seeing of signs and features needs to be discerned
in the background, it’s not something that you can stare at, because
signs and features are in the background of that which you are attending
to. You cannot see the mind as an object of your senses but you can
discern it peripherally and know it. That’s the principle of
cittanimtta.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong></p>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<p>“When the monk is one who is possessed of mindfulness &amp;
awareness… the Tathāgata then trains him further: ’(6)Come, monk. Seek
out a secluded dwelling: a wilderness, the shade of a tree, a mountain,
a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a forest grove, the open air, a heap
of straw …”. “(7)Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world, he
dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness. He cleanses his mind of
covetousness. Abandoning ill will &amp; anger, he dwells with an

these five hindrances—imperfections of awareness that weaken
discernment—then, quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from
unskillful qualities, he enters &amp; remains in the first jhāna: joy
&amp; pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought &amp;
evaluation…”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> If you want to abandon the hindrances which is a
prerequisite for entering jhana, then you need to be dwelling with your
mindfulness thorouhghly established, which means you need to be watchful
all the time, which means you need to be moderate in eating, guarding
the senses, celibate and keeping the precepts. In other words if you
want to enter jhana, start being celibate. You can realize that jhana is
an establishment of mind that results from your own efforts of purifying
your lifestyle. It’s not a magical experience that will purify your life
for you. Jhana is one of the last positive symptoms of you healing the
wounds of lust, hatred and ignorance. Dwell secluded, removing grief and
concern regarding the world, abandon the hindrances, quite secluded from
unwholesome states, the pleasure of seclusion is born, you feel safe and
that’s the entering and abiding in jhana. It’s not the other way
round.</p>
<p>Jhana is a divine abiding, as the Buddha stated “when the Tathagatas
mind is in jhana, whatever he does is divine…”. You can live in jhana
because the mind is purified, the senses tamed, the body guarded, the
guard post has not been abandoned, you have not been giving in to that
which makes hindrances overwhelm you, so you are freed from them. The
important thing is that jhana is the”8th step" in the gradual training,
which is where many contemporary teachings like to begin the training,
by bypassing all the prerequisites. Which is quite convenient for
ignorance.</p>
<p>If you withdraw yourself from the unwholesome, you don’t have to
worry about jhana, that is jhana. You don’t have to worry about a
technique, which incidentally you will not find in the suttas. The
closest thing to a method is what we have just been describing, the
gradual training - <span lang="pi"><em>Sekha Paṭipadā</em></span>.</p>
