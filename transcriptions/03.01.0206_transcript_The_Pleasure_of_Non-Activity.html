<div class="line-block">“Oh, when will I stay in a mountain cave,<br />
alone, with no companion,<br />
discerning all states of existence as impermanent?<br />
This hope of mine, when will it be?…<br />
<br />
…For many years you begged me,<br />
“Enough of living in a house for you!”<br />
Why do you not urge me on, mind,<br />
now that I’ve gone forth as an ascetic?<br />
<br />
…Mind, when you urge me to the impermanent and unstable,<br />
you’re acting like someone who plants trees,<br />
then, when they’re about to fruit,<br />
wishes to cut down the very same trees.<br />
Incorporeal mind, far-traveller, lone-wanderer:<br />
I won’t do your bidding any more.<br />
Sensual pleasures are suffering, painful, and very dangerous;<br />
I’ll wander with my mind focused only on Nibbana…<br />
<br />
…The men and women who live under your will and command,<br />
whatever pleasure they experience,<br />
they are ignorant and fall under Māra’s control;<br />
loving life, they’re your disciples, mind.”</div>

</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> That’s everyone’s relationship with their mind,
the only difference is how much perspective you have towards it or how
much you identify with it. The mind presents you with these ideas which
you accept and act out of and then you assume the ownership of them, but
you didn’t have a say in their creation, in their arising, the mind came
up with it, so you can realise that it’s not about “me” coming up with
it or “me” owning or disowning that which is not in my control. What is
up to me, is whether I choose to accept what the mind offers up. In the
same sense whether you choose to go where the eyes want to see. The eyes
want to go in a direction which you do not have to accept, but if people
have no self awareness and perspective developed through sense
restraint, then for them that pull is “theirs”, and ironically, they are
being pulled against their will but they believe that that’s what they
want to do. For Talaputta, in that sutta, he already had some wisdom
because he was already able to see the mind as”this thing”, as he
said”Oh you urged me to do this, I did this, and now you want to go
back”. Now if he didn’t have wisdom, he would have just thought “I want
to go back”, but he questioned the thought: “Is this what I want? No,
this is what my mind wants and that’s clear enough but is this what I
want?…no, I do not want to eat what has been”vomited up”, so to speak. I
was miserable over there and that’s why I left, so I don’t want to do
it, but the mind still wants it.” So there’s a conflict, you have a
choice, either give into the mind in order to not endure the conflict or
tame the mind in order to resolve the conflict, there will be no more
conflict when you(wisdom) are in charge.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> In the beginning the mind offered him something
quite appealing…</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes, due to his own contemplation and choices.
He also met the Buddha and at that time his mind thought that this
training was worth doing. Even his own mind was not happy in that
environment, which is why it presented him with these romantic ideas
about living in the forests, but when the reality of those romantic
ideas sets in, the hardships, enduring the insects, etc, then the mind
changed its mind: “Ohhh, I want to go back now”, but he questioned it:
“My mind has changed but shall I follow it…No”. It’s like when you start
seeing yourself as this creature, this six sensed animal. Those senses
will want to pull you in the direction they want to go but it’s you who
needs to stop gratuitously identifying with them and giving into their
pressure and then they will obey eventually, and how long that will take
depends on how much effort you put in.</p>
<p>The mind directs the other animals and it’s the hardest to tame but
it’s still the same principle. You can recognise that when you have a
thought, you can reflect further on it. For example, when the mind is
interested in sensuality, it will not think about the ugly aspects which
are simultaneously present there but you can make it do so, and that’s
what Talaputta decided to do: “No I will tie you down mind and I will
stay here where you first told me to go, because it was a good idea,
thank you, but now we are not changing this, we will stay here until you
listen to me, not the other way around.” So it’s not about not having
those thoughts and trying to prevent them from arising, thinking: “Oh I
shouldn’t be thinking this”. No, it’s not up to you what you think, it’s
up to your mind, but you should not be acting out of it, acting upon it
and accepting it without further consideration, that’s on you. You know
exactly where the line is, you know where your responsibility lies, the
mind can come up with whatever it wants, all you need to do is to not
entertain or encourage it, if what it offers is unwholesome.</p>
<p>It’s up to you to choose to accept the offer of the mind or not, to
go with it or not, and it’s also up to you to choose whether you allow
it to keep dwelling and revolving around a particular subject. It needs
your input and encouragement to keep revolving around sensuality or ill
will. You can develop the perception of danger or the perception of
abandoning, in those thoughts so that while the mind is thinking those
thoughts of sensuality, you are not wanting them and abandoning them
because they are dangerous. Instead of thinking: “I will have this mind,
never think of that again!”. That might be the final outcome of you
being completely dispassionate with what your mind presents you with,
but until then the mind will be presenting you with stuff the same as
any other sense will be presenting you with things it wants to do. You
must just not welcome thoughts if you know and see that it’s rooted in
sensuality, ill will or distraction. It doesn’t mean that you should
think: “I don’t want it, so let me make these thoughts go away!”. No, it
means that you should think: “I don’t want it, now let me endure this
unruly mind that is trying to harass me with these thoughts.”</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong></p>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<p>“…The Blessed One said,”Monks, if you are asked by wanderers of other
sects, ‘Friends, there are these three qualities. Which three? Lust,
aversion, and delusion. These are the three qualities. Now what is the
difference, what is the distinction, what is the distinguishing factor
among these three qualities?’- when thus asked, you should answer those
wanderers of other sects in this way: ’Friends, Lust carries little
blame and is slow to fade. Aversion carries great blame and is quick to
fade. Delusion carries great blame and is slow to fade…”</p>
<p>— <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.68">AN 3.68</a></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Delusion is not a missing piece of information,
it’s an existential attitude that you have towards your senses. That’s
why I often refer to it as distraction because it’s an active thing,
it’s something that you are liable to and doing here and now. Just like
greed and aversion, delusion is something you welcome, act upon, accept
and do not understand. It’s not like something you don’t know, it’s
something that you keep doing which is mistaken. It’s the attitude of
distraction, it’s about the movement of distraction, the movement of
having something to do to maintain your being. A good indicator would be
to measure it with boredom. If you are easily bored, that means you have
accumulated a lot of delusions that will be difficult to see and hard to
fade. If you never get bored, then you are at least an Anagami or
Arahant where there is no pressure of non-activity, no pressure to do
anything or to distract yourself or look away from nothing happening,
nothing being felt.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, boredom is a good way to practice. People don’t
see boredom as an indicator and certainly don’t see delusion as an
attitude that they cultivate, despite commitment to precepts, suttas,
and meditation. They always try to deal with boredom. Even when they are
practising, their meditation technique becomes something they do on
account of avoiding boredom. Your reading suttas or scholarly work
becomes something you do on account of avoiding boredom. Yes, you need
to know the suttas and collect that information in order to know what to
look for but sooner or later you need to start uprooting delusion for
what it is, and for that you need to endure and not depend on some
activity to keep you occupied and engaged and connected to the senses.
For example, if you decide to get bored, switch your phone off, close
the doors and curtains, it doesn’t matter whether you sit, walk, stand
or lay down, close your books, switch off the television, don’t do your
meditation technique, just abide in non-activity. The mind will then be
presenting you with something to do, which is fine, you don’t try to get
rid of those thoughts, you just don’t act upon them. However, if you
decide to get up or go to the toilet, those are not the kind of
activities that will distract you, but if you think: “Let me just check
my email…”, well that’s an activity of a kind that will distract you,
and so you don’t do that. Now if you do that for an hour, you will
probably feel intense boredom, and that’s why people fear solitude or
confinement where there is nothing to distract their senses. That can be
frightening, but in itself it’s not frightening. It is frightening
because you have always been depending on the momentum of action, but
that’s a gratuitous dependency that you have been cultivating because
you didn’t know any better and for as long you don’t know any better you
will be cultivating it.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <cite><a
href="https://suttacentral.net/sn9.10">SN 9.10 Sajjhāya
Sutta</a></cite>:</p>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<p>“On one occasion a certain bhikkhu was dwelling among the Kosalans in
a certain woodland thicket. Now on that occasion that bhikkhu had been
excessively engrossed in recitation, but on a later occasion he passed
the time living in non-activity (indifferent, withdrawn, at ease) and
keeping silent. Then the devata that inhabited that woodland thicket, no
longer hearing that bhikkhu recite the Dhamma, approached him and
addressed him in verse:”Bhikkhu, why don’t you recite Dhamma-stanzas,
Living in communion with other bhikkhus? Hearing the Dhamma, one gains
confidence; In this very life [the reciter] gains praise.”</p>
<p>The bhikkhu replied: “In the past I was fond of reciting
Dhamma-stanzas, so long as I had not achieved dispassion. But from the
time I achieved dispassion, I dwell in what the good men call:”The
laying down by final knowledge of whatever is seen, heard, or
sensed.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Are you delighting in projects and work? If yes,
that means you are delighting in distraction. Just try abide in true
non-activity for an hour or two, no meditation techniques or trying to
be mindful, just sit there, don’t fall asleep, get up or walk back and
forth if you are sleepy, and just allow your mind to come up with ideas
and things to do, planning and then don’t commit to them, just let those
thoughts endure and just sit about. Do that for a few hours and you will
see that there is going to be a space created between you and your
senses, because that identification that people naturally jump into,
i.e, “When eye wants to see = I want to see”, that identification, that
proximity with the senses needs maintenance. However, if you don’t act
upon impulse and create that space, then you will get to see this sense
creature for what it is, the mind THERE with thoughts wanting to do this
and that, the monkey mind, you get to see it because you stop getting
driven by it. Now say that that is your practice for most of the day,
abiding in non-activity, wakeful, watching your mind, and then when you
commit to do something with body, speech or mind, you do so only on the
level of that recognition that it will not cause further distraction.
You do them through the mind of non-activity, non-distraction. That’s
why in jhana you can walk, eat, go to the toilet, etc, it’s not like
you’re frozen motionless. Non-activity means no activity that is rooted
in distraction. It will also then become clear what you are not
distracting yourself from, which is - yourself, the six sensed creature,
the pressure.</p>
<p>That’s why people fear boredom, it will always turn into existential
anxiety, because you start seeing how divorced from your own sense you
are, from the things that you identify with, things that define who or
what you are. It’s just like if someone releases a balloon which floats
away higher and higher, that’s your mind, there is no end to how high it
can go, and there is no problem in how high it goes, the problem is from
your expectation, need and dependence on being tethered to the senses,
because you haven’t been restraining yourself enough, you haven’t been
seeing the danger in the slightest fault, so you have been depending on
action through your senses.</p>
<p>Everybody depends on having something to do, but some depend on it
more than others, like when a person constantly needs to be active and
when they are not active they get bored, restless and then anxiety sets
in, and then no matter how insignificant something is, it becomes the
most important thing that must be done. That anxiety and desperation is
only there because they refuse to give up the gratuitous assumption that
the senses belong to them and are worth holding onto. If you give that
up then non-activity is the most sublime thing, but as I said, the
pleasure of jhana, the pleasure of the neutral feeling needs to be
understood and developed, it’s not automatic. That’s also why, let’s
say, if you have been confined in a room for a long time and then you
are released, it doesn’t matter how unpleasant a chore you would have to
go and do, you will enjoy it because at least you feel that there is
something for you to do, if you are still dependent on action. Now you
can realise that having the pleasure of something to do is determined
from how far your mind has withdrawn, but then you see people who never
experience boredom because they always have something to do and to
distract themselves with, they are people who really go into sensuality.
There is nothing sensual about cleaning a toilet, you just enjoy the
action in itself because the boredom was a bit too much to handle, but
say you never experienced boredom or seperation or withdrawal from the
senses, no perspective in regard to them, all you do is engage in the
senses, that’s when you now need even more engagement for any sense of
pleasure and that’s why the more you engage in sensuality the less
pleasure you feel and the more you need to engage. But say you have been
withdrawn from sensuality for a long time then even just a little bit of
mundane engagement with the senses will be agreeable, but that doesn’t
constitute sensuality. Engaging with a sense in itself does not
constitute sensuality.</p>
<p>The Buddha describes the difference between pleasure that is
underlied by more craving and pleasure that isn’t. Pleasure of cleaning
the toilet is not underlined by craving it’s actually determined by the
fact that you haven’t been engaging in sensuality and you don’t need to
fear that pleasure but you need to be careful because you might then be
trying to find random things to do because they are not sensual but they
can become distracting and if they do, then your mind will start
thinking sensual thoughts, and that’s the same principle taken even
further.</p>
<p>Now say you don’t fear the boredom or neutral feeling anymore, it’s
not felt unpleasantly because you have understood it, you basically live
withdrawn from sensuality, you have developed jhana, so your mind is now
even more established on the separation from the senses and their pulls.
That’s why then from that perspective, even enduring discomfort will
feel like divine pleasure. From the point of view of boredom, cleaning
the toilet will feel exhilarating, from the point of view of jhana,
physical endurance like eating rough food, living at the root of a tree,
wearing rough robes, using harsh medicines, will feel like the finest
requisites. It’s the same principle, determined by how much your mind is
withdrawn that determines how pleasantly the engagement will be
experienced. Not in itself, but for some people who get as much
sensuality as they want, they feel numb because they have been engaging
with that level for so long, their mind has not been withdrawn. It’s the
same principle of withdrawal, in boredom, if you work through it, if you
don’t act out of it and even endure that anxiety if it arises, then even
chores will be felt as agreeable. Now if you develop that further into a
jhana, then even if you don’t do any chores, just enduring the elements
will be agreeable, will be felt pleasantly from the point of view of
being so withdrawn, and that’s why the Buddha encouraged the venerable
Anuruddha to develop jhana:</p>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<p>“…Now, when you think these eight thoughts of a great person and
become a person who can attain at will, without trouble or difficulty,
these four jhānas—heightened mental states providing a pleasant abiding
in the here &amp; now—then your robe of cast-off rags will seem to you
to be just like the clothes chest of a householder or householder’s son,
full of clothes of many colors. As you live contented, it will serve for
your delight, for a comfortable abiding, for non-agitation, &amp; for
reaching Nibbana.</p>
<p>“When you think these eight thoughts of a great person and become a
person who can attain at will, without trouble or difficulty, these four
jhānas—heightened mental states providing a pleasant abiding in the here
&amp; now—then your meal of almsfood will seem to you to be just like
the rice &amp; wheat of a householder or householder’s son, cleaned of
black grains, and served with a variety of sauces &amp; seasonings….</p>
<p>…Your dwelling at the foot of a tree will seem to you to be just like
the gabled mansion of a householder or householder’s son, plastered
inside &amp; out, draft-free, bolted, and with its shutters closed….
your bed on a spread of grass will seem to you like the couch of a
householder or householder’s son, spread with long-haired coverlets,
white woolen coverlets, embroidered coverlets, antelope-hide &amp;
deer-skin rugs, covered with a canopy, and with red cushions for the
head &amp; feet….</p>
<p>…Your medicine of fermented cows urine will seem to you to be just
like the various tonics of a householder or householder’s son: ghee,
fresh butter, oil, honey, and molasses sugar. As you live contented, it
will serve for your delight, for a comfortable abiding, for
non-agitation, &amp; for reaching Nibbana…”</p>

</div>
<p>You don’t need to fear enjoying rough robes and thinking that it is
sensuality. Only a person who is not free from sensuality would use that
as a reference and think everything is sensuality because that’s the
only reference they have. Even the Buddha himself initially thought that
the pleasure of withdrawal is unwholesome:</p>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<p>“I (the Buddha) thought: ‘I recall once, when my father the Sakyan
was working, and I was sitting in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree,
then—quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful
qualities—I entered &amp; remained in the first jhāna: rapture &amp;
pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought &amp; evaluation.
Could that be the path to awakening?’ Then there was the thought
following that memory: ‘That is the path to awakening.’ I thought: ‘So
why am I afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality,
nothing to do with unskillful qualities?’ I thought: ’I am no longer
afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality, nothing
to do with unskillful qualities, but that pleasure is not easy to
achieve with a body so extremely emaciated…”</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>If you are enjoying living in the jungle wearing rough robes and
enduring insects, if you find that agreeable, you don’t need to fear
that as though it was sensuality, because it is not. That agreeability
of it is determined by your state of lofty mind. If you are not
distracting yourself, you will inevitably find things enjoyable, and if
you develop jhanas, even the extreme pain of disease can be endured
because your mind can attain jhanas at will. In other words, if your
mind can reestablish itself as fully withdrawn and independent of any
sense at any time, then how could it be bothered by anything that comes
through any sense?</p>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<p>“Then Venerable Mahākassapa went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat
down to one side. The Buddha said to him:”You’re old now, Kassapa. Those
worn-out hempen rag robes must be a burden for you. So Kassapa, you
should wear clothes given by householders, accept invitations for the
meal, and stay in my presence.”</p>
<p>“For a long time, sir, I’ve lived in the wilderness, eaten only
alms-food, worn rag robes, and owned just three robes; and I’ve praised
these things. I’ve been one of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, and
energetic; and I’ve praised these things.”</p>
<p>“But seeing what benefit, Kassapa, have you long practiced these
things?”</p>
<p>“Sir, seeing two benefits I have long practiced these things. I see a
happy life for myself in the present. And I have compassion for future
generations, thinking: ‘Hopefully those who come after might follow my
example.’ For they may think: ‘It seems that the awakened disciples of
the Buddha for a long time lived in the wilderness, ate only alms-food,
wore rag robes, and owned just three robes; and they praised these
things. They were of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, and
energetic; and they praised these things.’ They’ll practice accordingly,
which will be for their lasting welfare and happiness. Seeing these two
benefits I have long practiced these things.”</p>
<p>“Good, good, Kassapa! You’re acting for the welfare and happiness of
the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.
So Kassapa, wear worn-out hempen rag robes, walk for alms, and stay in
the wilderness.”</p>

</div>
<p>The relativity of hardship and endurance is determined by how much
your mind is withdrawn from these things or not and that’s why it’s not
incidental that boredom is that thing that nobody wants to deal with,
even people who practice the dhamma, they do so to avoid sinking into
that boredom.</p>
<p>Say you have been sitting for a few hours in your room, everything is
switched off, no notifications, no activity, and then you want to get up
and drink tea, that’s fine, but now your mind starts to overthink it,
wants to get into the details, that’s what you do not welcome, which
does not mean that you have to never drink tea again. You will not lose
sight of yourself which means even the making of the tea will not become
a basis for that self-deluding whereby you become unaware of yourself
and fall into the identification of the senses you are engaging with,
you still maintain that distance, that right perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If you are living in such a non-distracted way,
your life naturally becomes simple and minimalistic.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> The amount of proliferation and elaboration
towards the senses and engagement with them will have to fade. That’s
why walking, talking and sleeping, is not sensual in itself, but can be
the basis for slowing down the sotapannas progress. For one with the
right view, if he were to practice sense restraint and learn to abide in
non-activity even more, he can become an Arahant in this life, but some
get distracted with work talk and sleep which becomes an obstruction to
their own progress. That’s why the Buddha admonished some of his ariyan
disciples:</p>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<p>“…Now on that occasion the venerable Ānanda, along with many
bhikkhus, were busy making robes at Ghāṭā the Sakyan’s dwelling. Then,
when it was evening, the Blessed One rose from retreat and went to Ghāṭā
the Sakyan’s dwelling. There he sat down on a seat made ready and asked
the venerable Ānanda:</p>
<p>“Ānanda, there are many resting places prepared in Kāḷakhemaka the
Sakyan’s dwelling. Do many bhikkhus live there?”</p>
<p>“Venerable sir, many resting places have been prepared in Kāḷakhemaka
the Sakyan’s dwelling. Many bhikkhus are living there. This is our time
for making robes, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“Ānanda, a bhikkhu does not shine by delighting in company, by taking
delight in company, by devoting himself to delight in company; by
delighting in society, by taking delight in society, by rejoicing in
society. Indeed, Ānanda, it is not possible that a bhikkhu who delights
in company, takes delight in company, and devotes himself to delight in
company, who delights in society, takes delight in society, and rejoices
in society, will ever obtain at will, without trouble or difficulty, the
bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the
bliss of enlightenment. But it can be expected that when a bhikkhu lives
alone, withdrawn from society, he will obtain at will, without trouble
or difficulty, the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the
bliss of peace, the bliss of Nibbana…”</p>

<p>The amount of work that they were engaged with was obviously not
necessary and the Buddha rebuked them even though that work was not
sensual. If you lose the context and do not maintain your motivation
behind your engagement with work, talk and sleep, it will then become a
basis for maintaining delusion. Obviously for an Ariyan, he maintains
that delusion much subtler than a puthujjana would be doing but it’s
still a form of that self distraction and all he would need to do is not
engage or not allow himself to be engaged with work, talk and sleep for
the purpose of distraction, then he will progress towards Nibbana, there
is no other effort he needs to make because he has already understood
the Dhamma.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> He makes an effort in non-activity…</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Well it’s the effort in protecting the mind of
non-activity, as it is praised in the suttas:</p>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<p>“…then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus:”Come,
bhikkhu, tell that bhikkhu in my name that the Teacher calls him.”</p>
<p>“Yes, venerable sir,” that bhikkhu replied, and he went to that
bhikkhu and told him: “The Teacher calls you, friend.”</p>
<p>“Yes, friend,” that bhikkhu replied, and he approached the Blessed
One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.</p>
<p>The Blessed One then said to him: “Is it true, bhikkhu, that after
returning from the alms round you enter your dwelling after the meal and
pass the time living in non-activity and keeping silent, and you do not
render service to the bhikkhus at the time of making robes?”</p>
<p>“I am doing my own duty, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, having known with his own mind the reflection
in that bhikkhu’s mind, addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, do not find fault with this bhikkhu. This bhikkhu is one
who gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhanas that
constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant dwelling in this very
life. And he is one who, by realising it for himself with direct
knowledge, in this very life enters and dwells in that unsurpassed goal
of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from
the household life into homelessness.”</p>
<p>— <cite><a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn21.4">SN

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>That pleasant abiding here and now paired with your right view is
basically jhana that leads you to nibbana. But as I said many times,
jhana is not a product of your activity, jhana is a product of
withdrawal from the senses and engagement from the unwholesome, it’s the
pleasure and security that comes from that type of non-activity. But
again, non-activity is whether you are motivated by distraction or not,
and not whether you are motionless or moving about. You might jump to
the conclusion that non-activity means being motionless for 3 hours,
refusing to move because that will be a distraction from non-activity.
No, non-activity means non-distraction (*devoted to
vigilance/watchfulness/non-distraction - <span
lang="pi"><em>jagariyam-anuyoga</em></span>).</p>
<p>Just sit in your room and you will see in just a short time the mind
will present you with something to do. If you are relishing that offer,
that is the activity, that is the distraction. However, not acting on
the impulse to act is already creating some space between you and the
senses, that’s why none of this will be possible if you do not first get
accomplished in the first few steps of the gradual training ( 1-keeping
the precepts, 2-guarding the senses, 3-moderation in eating, 4- devoted
to watchfulness, …). Non-activity is not using any type of action for
the means of distracting yourself from yourself or for losing the
perspective of this creature that needs to be contained, tamed and
watched.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> And there’s nothing like the maintaining of the
right perspective for the diminishing of delusion.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Sure, if you start giving in to these
distracting activities, the right perspective will diminish or will be
more obscured, and if you don’t give in to those acts of
self-distraction, the right perspective is maintained. You don’t need to
try to keep the perspective, all you need to do is protect it from
distraction. Once you stop being engaged with the world with work and
whatever else you have to do, you can then realise that there is enough
space for you here to see if the actions that you are about to do are
being used for the pleasure of indolence and forgetting about this
creature that you do need to keep an eye on. (You don’t need to be
choking that creature and tying it up, but you do need to not lose sight
of it.)</p>
<p>So now that you have finished your work and return home to rest, does
that include binge watching movies, having a drink, listening to music,
etc? Why do you need to do that in order to relax? All you need to do
for relaxation is not do any work. You can easily relax yourself by
doing nothing or something non-distracting that will not result in you
wanting to do more of it and losing sight of yourself. You want to relax
but not to the point where you lose sight of the creature that you need
to keep an eye on. Often people conflate the two, thinking: ’I have done
my work, now I can relax”, which means I can lose sight and become
distracted. No, you can relax, but at no point does that mean that you
should lose sight of the six-sensed creature. That’s the difference
between activity and non-activity. If you don’t lose the sight of the
creature, you will not be acting on the level of the creature even if
you are doing chores, you will be doing them through the mind of
non-activity, only to the minimal point of need and fulfilling the
purpose and then you are back in non-activity abiding in jhana. Same
with eating, you do it to the extent that you need it, and eating more
than you need is no longer seen as pleasant because what is pleasurable
is protecting the mind of non-distraction which makes everything else
pleasurable from that higher stance. You realise that’s the true
pleasure, pleasure which is not underlied by craving for more. That type
of pleasure is not unwholesome, it’s safe and you are mindful in it, so
it’s a win-win.</p>
