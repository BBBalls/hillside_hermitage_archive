<p>The reason why understanding is hard to develop, is because in order
to do so, one needs to know what must be understood. That might sound
self explanatory, but the point is, understanding takes repetition. One
needs to make the effort of repetitive investigation or drilling into a
certain topic or theme that needs to be clarified, i.e. the theme or
aspect of experience that one wants to develop clarity in regard to. In
order to do that, you need to know what to look for, you need to know
how to approach it and what to understand. Getting information about it
is absolutely necessary, but information in itself, as vast as it can
be, is not ‘understanding’. Which is something that many people would
confuse; knowing a lot about something does not mean you understand it,
especially when it comes down to the Nature of things, feelings,
intentions, or the Nature of experience as a whole.</p>
<p>When it comes to practising the Dhamma, many people mystify it, as
in, go after an experience of some kind of new amazing feeling which
they can interpret as understanding/enlightenment, a kind of ‘intuitive
wisdom’. However, if you cannot explain an experience or make it
intelligible to yourself or to somebody else, you should not think you
understood it. Now, of course you’re free to use your own words, so to
speak, you don’t have to use already given templates of descriptions and
so on. But the point is, you will still be able to convey the meaning if
you understood that experience in its <em>nature</em>, and that’s the
crucial factor here, the meaning of the experience, the meaning of
whatever might have happened to you that you think was somehow worthy in
your practice, in your meditation or in any other area of life for that
matter. And that’s when you realise that most of the time, even things
that you think you understand, upon which you act and choose to live
your life, you haven’t actually understood the meaning behind, you just
act, you just go along with it, i.e. it made some vague sense to you, or
as the Buddha said, you will be doing these things or holding those
views, simply because it pleases you, simply because it “feels” good,
and that’s the sole criteria for most people. They find an idea pleasing
and that’s why they defend their view and their actions based on their
chosen views. Either way, there is no understanding of those things.
That’s the important difference that we are trying to highlight here.
Basically it’s not about the experience that you might have, it’s about
understanding it. And if understanding is the focus, that’s when you
realise the content of the experience doesn’t matter as much, as long as
it’s wholesome, as long as it’s based on restraint and virtue, then you
realise it’s the understanding of any experience which results in
freedom from suffering, that matters.</p>
<p>The reason why this practice, given by the Buddha, the practice of
<em>understanding</em> is harder than just sitting and trying to develop
calmness or pleasant feeling through some practice of concentration, is
because it will result initially, in causing doubt and restlessness in
your mind. But that’s how you know that you are doing it properly. By
working through these things, you learn to be imperturbable in the face
of the thinking mind, not the other way round. You’re afraid of the
thinking mind because it disturbs you, and then you try to stop the
thinking, you try to concentrate on a little point so you don’t have to
think about anything else. However, you need to develop strength in the
face of that which wants to move you, in order to be immovable, not
control the content that disturbs you. So it’s important to then
obviously read the Suttas and get the idea as to what needs to be
understood. But very often, it comes down to that tedious, ambiguous,
heavy drilling of your thought.</p>
<p>Sit down in a quiet, non-crowded environment and ask yourself,
“Intention, intention, what is intention? Do I know what intention is
for me, for myself, in my own experience? When I say intention, what do
I refer to? Is it understood? What is it? Whatever it is, do I try to
understand it, or do I just sort of float on the surface of the meaning
of intention? Is the meaning vague? How would I describe my
intention?”</p>
<p>Try writing down what your intention is and then afterwards, read
that back to yourself and see if it makes any sense. If it does, then
push the questions further. So, in this case, you ask, “So what is
intent? What is my intention? Like now, I have the intention to be
seated here and contemplate the nature of intention? What is the
intention that’s making me do this? What is it? Is it a fleeting
thought? Well, it isn’t, because I’m still seated, trying to contemplate
these things. Which means that that thought is present throughout these
more particular actions that I’m doing, that I’m trying to contemplate.
I remain seated, I still haven’t switched on my phone, I still haven’t
opened my door to the world. So, all these other things I do are on the
basis of a simultaneously present more general intention, which is to
ponder on the nature of intention, or the nature of feeling or the
nature of five aggregates ….”. So how else would you then describe that
presently enduring intention? Is it a thought? Is it some sort of
perception? It is, because if it weren’t, you wouldn’t be able to talk
about it, you wouldn’t be able to designate it even for yourself, let
alone for others. So, it’s a peripheral thought, which in this case, I
have the intention to sit down and contemplate.</p>
<p>You don’t have to keep it in front of your mind, as in, while you’re
sitting and contemplating. You don’t have to keep saying to yourself, “I
want to sit, I want to sit, I want to contemplate, that’s my intention.”
No, because these actions already carry that intention. That’s how
intentions work. That’s why I keep saying the most important thing for
somebody who wants to start the practice or somebody who’s already
developing it, is to develop full transparency in regard to present
enduring motivations behind the smallest of actions. That’s how you get
to discern the fundamental aspect of wholesome or unwholesome, good or
bad, healthy or unhealthy, and especially to discern where your actions
are rooted. Because if you’re not aware of this peripheral thought of
your intention that directs all of your particular actions, while it
endures, you’re not aware of where that action or those actions are
rooted.</p>
<p>Intention is wholesome or unwholesome or neutral, but for practical
sake, just look for wholesome and unwholesome, if it’s unwholesome avoid
it, if it’s wholesome, don’t try to deny it or fear it, just let it be,
let it endure. Either way, they arise on their own, but your
responsibility is not to try to prevent them from arising, your
responsibility is to prevent yourself from acting out of it. So as I
said, even if you’re a beginner, sit down, quietly, in a semi-protected
environment, undistracted, and question the things you’re doing and
things you want to do. Bring them forward to your mind, and then think
about why you want to act, “Oh, it’s because of this and that. Well, why
is this and that a reason for me doing these things? Why did I choose
that to be the reason?”.</p>
<p>It’s always on you, intention is always your responsibility. That’s
why the Buddha said that every action is an intention. You can’t commit
an action without having it rooted in an intention. And that’s what
“beings are owners of their actions” means. Only you, nobody else, which
means you are fundamentally always responsible for what you choose to
do. That’s not negotiable or optional.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Beings are owners of their actions, heirs of their actions, born of
their actions, related through their actions, and have their actions as
their arbitrator. Action is what differentiates beings in terms of
baseness &amp; excellence.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ask yourself, “What is the intention? When I say intention,
intention? What am I referring to in this experience as a whole?”. We
have established it’s a sort of ambiguous peripheral thought, an idea or
context of all these little things that you are doing. You don’t have to
keep staring at little things that you’re doing in order to discern
intention. Why? Because the intention always comes first structurally,
simultaneously the intentions and actions are present. But intention is
deeper, so to speak, it’s not that you have the intention and then the
actions. No, you have intentions and you have your environment in regard
to which you have intentions. But that’s when you recognise that these
intentions determine the course of my action, and for that I’m
responsible for saying yes or no to them.</p>
<p>So, we established that an intention in the most fundamental, most
basic, the most straightforward description, is a thought, a right
thought or a bad thought. You have a thought that gives the context to
your present actions. But if you’re unaware of that thought, it means
you are unaware of the nature of it, whether the nature is wholesome or
unwholesome. And if that is the case, that means you will not know
whether your actions are rooted in good or bad. Through avoiding
responsibility for your intentions, you end up avoiding responsibility
for your actions down the line. That’s why the five or eight precepts,
i.e. virtue, always has to come first.</p>
<p>You have to start narrowing down your ‘avoidance of responsibility’.
Someone who doesn’t keep the precepts, he avoids responsibility left and
right and there is no base for Dhamma whatsoever. If you start keeping
the precepts, that’s where you create a basis for progress in Dhamma.
You might avoid responsibility here and there, and until you invest
enough work into that, and rectify that, at least you will not avoid
responsibility past this point, past the five precepts or eight, and so
on. You start rounding up that avoidance of responsibility for your
actions, and that can then bring further clarity to the fact that your
responsibility goes even beyond that, that you are responsible for
welcoming the thought of greed, the thought of aversion, ill will,
cruelty, and the thought of distraction. That’s why the Buddha would
say, the noble disciple, the one with the right view, who has developed
clarity in regard to the nature of his intentions, all he has to do is
not tolerate and not delight and not welcome the unwholesome thoughts.
All he has to do is not be ignorant and distract himself from wholesome
thoughts.</p>
<p>So when unwholesome/unhealthy intentions arise, he’s aware of it, he
understands it, and all he needs to do is abstain from doing anything on
account of it. He knows, “I will not welcome this and I will not
entertain this thought to stay for even a second longer.”. If that
attitude is present, it will be impossible for him to act out of it. The
only way you can act out of unwholesome intentions, is if you ignore
that they are unwholesome because as soon as you’re aware of their
unwholesomeness, you cannot act, it’s mutually exclusive. You must
ignore the unwholesome in order to act out of it. And that’s exactly why
ignorance is the most blameworthy, it’s a fundamental prerequisite for
anything unwholesome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Blessed One said this: Bhikkhus, before my awakening, while I
was still only seeking awakening, it occurred to me: ’Suppose that I
divide my thoughts into two classes. Then I set on one side thoughts of
sensual desire, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of cruelty, and I set
on the other side thoughts of renunciation, thoughts of non-ill will,
and thoughts of non-cruelty.</p>
<p>“As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, a thought of
sensual desire (<em>and a thought of either ill-will or cruelty</em>)
arose in me. I understood thus: ‘This thought of sensual desire has
arisen in me. This leads to my own affliction, to others’ affliction,
and to the affliction of both; it obstructs wisdom, causes difficulties,
and leads away from Nibbāna.’ - When I considered: ‘This leads to my own
affliction,’ it subsided in me; when I considered: ‘This leads to
others’ affliction,’ it subsided in me; when I considered: ‘This leads
to the affliction of both,’ it subsided in me; when I considered: ‘This
obstructs wisdom, causes difficulties, and leads away from Nibbāna,’ it
subsided in me. Whenever a thought of sensual desire arose in me, I
abandoned it, removed it, and did away with it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, whatever a bhikkhu frequently thinks and ponders upon,
that will become the inclination of his mind. If he frequently thinks
and ponders upon thoughts of sensual desire, he has abandoned the
thought of renunciation to cultivate the thought of sensual desire, and
then his mind inclines to thoughts of sensual desire. If he frequently
thinks and ponders upon thoughts of ill will…upon thoughts of cruelty,
he has abandoned the thought of non-cruelty to cultivate the thought of
cruelty, and then his mind inclines to thoughts of cruelty.</p>
<p>“Just as in the last month of the rainy season, in the autumn, when
the crops thicken, a cowherd would guard his cows by constantly tapping
and poking them on this side and that with a stick to check and curb
them. Why is that? Because he sees that he could be flogged, imprisoned,
fined, or blamed if he let them stray into the crops. So too I
understood, in unwholesome states there is danger, degradation, and
defilement, and in wholesome states the blessing of renunciation, the
aspect of cleansing.</p>
<p>“As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, a thought of
renunciation arose in me. I understood thus: ‘This thought of
renunciation has arisen in me. This does not lead to my own affliction,
or to others’ affliction, or to the affliction of both; it aids wisdom,
does not cause difficulties, and leads to Nibbāna. If I think and ponder
upon this thought even for a night, even for a day, even for a night and
day, I see nothing to fear from it. But with excessive thinking and
pondering I might tire my body, and when the body is tired, the mind
becomes strained, and when the mind is strained, it is far from
composure.’ So I steadied, stilled, unified and composed my mind
internally. Why is that? So that my mind should not be strained…”</p>

<p><em>Avijja</em>-Ignorance it’s not some sort of metaphysical and
mysterious cloud of unknowing that deludes you, it’s this very act of
ignoring your responsibility, avoiding transparency, avoiding the
recognition of your choice in regards to the present intention. That’s
ignorance and that’s how you carry it, you perpetuate it through your
own actions. Ignorant actions perpetuate ignorance because of which
actions are ignorant. It’s a vicious circle, but you can break through
it if you start accepting that responsibility, if you start looking at
the motivation behind your action, and develop clarity in regard to its
nature.</p>
<p>As I said, ask yourself, “What is the nature of intention? When I say
intention what do I refer to? Do I refer to a specific or general
thought, to a mood, a feeling, what is it?” The main problem is not
necessarily not being able to give an answer right away. The main
problem is not even attempting to think about it in the first place,
which is what most people do because initially it’s so ambiguous. It’s
going to take a lot of effort because we are used to just being focused
on the content/positive aspect as opposed to the negative, i.e. the
background context. So now you have to be discerning the <em>nature</em>
in regard to the present content. That’s why this kind of thinking
requires constant drilling/repetition, and the prerequisites of virtue
and sense restraint in order for understanding to take root. Otherwise,
it just won’t happen, you will just be floating from one content to
another.</p>
<p>You can pick up any theme, like the aggregate of feeling, for
example, and ask yourself: “What do I feel right now? What is the nature
of the feeling? How would I describe it? Is it an idea? If I say,”Oh, I
feel light, heavy, etc,” are those feelings or are those perceptions of
lightness and so on? Feelings, as the suttas say, are pleasant,
unpleasant, or neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant. So all these perceptions
I’m talking about, I feel light, I feel heavy, I feel this, I feel like
that, etc. Where are they rooted, presently? Is it pleasant, unpleasant
or neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant?…” .That’s how you start clarifying
the feeling. You realise that most often, things we think feelings are,
are actually perceptions, thoughts and concepts. And you will be talking
about those things as your feelings, for as long as you don’t make the
effort to think about what the actual feeling is.</p>
<p>You can see that the practice of Right understanding, the practice of
developing the Right view, is not about building some intricate system
of special meditation techniques that will then culminate in release of
all bad energy and involve a mystical experience, through practice and
effort. It’s about undoing the state of a <em>puthujjana</em>, the state
of an ignorant ordinary person who is a prey to suffering. That state is
the starting point for everyone. It’s not about building something new
on top of the state of an ignorant <em>puthujjana</em>, it’s about
removing everything that makes you a <em>puthujjana</em>. That’s how you
become a <em>sotapanna</em> free from suffering.</p>
<p>Lack of understanding, replaced with understanding, means that all
the wrong views are gone. Lack of understanding in regard to what? In
regards to the nature of your experience, the five aggregates, in
regards to the suffering and freedom from it, in regard to any topic
from the suttas. Fully understand those themes that matter and you would
have then undone your ignorance that was maintaining your ignorant state
of a <em>puthujjana</em>.</p>
<p>In terms of meditation, you don’t have to start with some complex
topics. Just pick up things/themes that you think you know and then
really investigate them. By that, I mean, contemplate them rightly, not
just think about the information you have about it. Pick up things you
know, and see whether you really know them. Don’t pull any punches,
don’t be afraid of what you might discover. Dedicate yourself to
clarifying the meaning, which means make yourself open to the
possibility of doubt, which can be very unpleasant. And the way you’re
going to deal with that doubt will be self-evident if you have your
virtue established beforehand. If you’ve been living virtuously and you
recognise the necessity of that virtue, that will take care of the
unpleasantness of doubt and restlessness and so on. But you have to go
through with it. The longer a person who wants to practice Dhamma,
avoids this, the harder it’s going to be to do it later.</p>
<p>Ask yourself about the things you think you understood. Whatever it
is, whatever sutta you read and you think you made sense of, question it
or even ask yourself what do you want to get out of the practice? Do you
want peace? How would you define that peace? Do you have clarity in
regard to what peace means? What does it mean? Peaceful means
non-disturbed. Okay, so take it a step further. What is the disturbance
then? How are you disturbed? Are you disturbed when you experience
things you don’t want to experience? Are you disturbed when you don’t
experience things you want to experience? What’s in common to any form
of disturbance? What’s in common is, it is suffering, it’s unpleasant.
If disturbance is not unpleasant, it wouldn’t be a disturbance. So, you
want peace, which is freedom from disturbance, which means peace is
freedom from unpleasant feeling, freedom from suffering. Peace equals
absence of suffering altogether.</p>
<p>Now, of course, that makes sense. But by going through these motions
of repetitive self-reflexive contemplating, you’re actually clarifying
things layer by layer and next time when something bothers you, when you
suffer on account of it, you will realise, “Well, I’m not automatically
disturbed by things that bother me, I’m only disturbed when I start
suffering on account of things that bother me, so peace is not, not
having anything come my way. Peace is about not being disturbed, not
suffering on account of whatever comes my way.” Ultimately, sickness,
ageing and death will come your way, that’s not negotiable. So these
little layers that you will be undoing through reflection. That’s all
that matters. That’s how you practice gradually, bit by bit.</p>
<p>When the Buddha says that the root of suffering is your own craving,
not the conditions in regard to which you crave, then you can realise
that you’re affected by disturbance of any kind because you disturb
yourself, nobody or nothing else does that to you. That can sound quite
blunt in a way, but at the same time, it’s the best possible news you
can receive because if suffering were truly rooted in circumstances or
other people’s actions, you can’t control that, you can’t even access
that and therefore you wouldn’t be able to free yourself from it. But it
isn’t rooted in external circumstances, and that’s the good news.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s teaching should be considered as a very strict form of
optimism. It’s recognising the problem and knowing exactly what to do
about it. Its recognising that the problem of you being disturbed by
things which make you non-peaceful, lies in you craving for the present
pleasant feeling, to stay longer or simply to stay, craving for the
present unpleasant feeling to go away, as soon as possible, and craving
for the neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling to be ignored or not to
be experienced. Practically, those are the three attitudes that
perpetuate your liability to suffering.</p>
<p>In order to stop craving in regard to these feelings, you have to
learn how to discern these feelings for what they are. Which brings us
to the questions we brought up earlier,“Feeling, feeling, what is
feeling? When I say feeling, what am I referring to? What is that
phenomenon? What is that thing, present in my experience as a whole,
that I designate by saying feeling?”. How would you describe your
pleasant feeling? Don’t jump to conclusions, just pause, ask yourself
the question, let the question endure for as long as it will and if your
mind starts wandering away, ask the question again and then try to think
about it a little bit more, but don’t rush into an answer. Why? Because
you don’t want to be producing the answer, you want to be discerning it.
Why? Because that present feeling is present. You don’t need to answer
it in order for that feeling to be there. The fact that you were able to
designate it means it’s there. It’s your preconceived notions about the
feeling, which obscures you understanding its nature. That’s what <a
href="https://suttacentral.net/mn1">Mūlapariyāyasutta</a> is all about,
it describes all the conceivings that you do on account of the arisen
experience, not before the arisen experience. It’s about clearing out
your “conceivings” and discerning things in their <em>nature</em>. If
you can discern the nature of the presently enduring feeling, then you
will be unable to crave it.</p>
