<p><strong>Ajahn Nyanamoli:</strong> Could you give me a mundane example
of samadhi (composure)?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The inability to be disturbed by disturbing
events.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Like when someone is in a good mood throughout
the day, they are not affected by bad or disturbing events.</p>
<p>The reason why I’m asking this is because it’s not just the composure
of an idea (it is partially). But that idea implies emotional composure
as a background of it. So, a <em>mood</em> would be an example. Equally,
someone’s mind can be composed in a bad mood. This means that even good
things would annoy and irritate them.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Anything that happens comes within that bad mood.
Everything has a disagreeable baseline. Or an agreeable baseline if
they’re in a good mood.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes. Do people have a say in their moods?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> No. You can’t change it. It presents itself on
its own.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> That’s true on that level. Can you think of
another level in which a person does have a say in their mood?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Putting oneself in a good mood is possible. As an
example, reminding oneself of how fortunate one is compared to others.
Doing certain things, and reflecting in certain ways, keeps my mood from
getting bad.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes. The moods are indeed phenomena on their
own. However, are you allowing your wild mind to go where it wants? When
that happens, moods get depressed and agitated. Or are you trying to
restrain it? As a result, you will feel happier and lighter. Therefore,
you do not control the <em>phenomenon</em> of mood being present, but
you do control the indirect cultivation of that mood.</p>
<p>As the Buddha said, even if one lives a non-celibate life, i.e. a
householder’s life, but frequently recollects the Buddha, Dhamma,
Sangha, and their own virtue, then he will gain a pleasant abiding, a
good mood - a kind of <em>samadhi</em> right now. When the mind is
directed toward reflecting upon certain values, it becomes composed in
that direction. So, day after day, you want to make a practice of
reflecting upon the right things, even when you don’t feel like it.</p>
<p>If you want a higher pleasant abiding, that will require more
restraint, but it boils down to frequent remembrance and reflection.
That is what will incline the mind. Whatever one frequently thinks
about, that’s where the mind is inclined to go. Is it sensuality or
non-sensuality? Is it irritation, fault finding, ill will, or
non-irritation, non-fault finding, non-ill will? One direction inclines
to suffering and the other does not.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>On one occasion…The Blessed One said this: Bhikkhus, before my
enlightenment, while I was still seeking enlightenment, it occurred to
me:</p>
<p>Suppose that I divide my thinking into two classes. Then I set on one
side thinking pertaining to sensuality, aversion, and cruelty, and I set
on the other side thinking pertaining to non-sensuality, non-ill will,
and non-cruelty.</p>
<p>As I lived thus (in solitude), diligent, persistent, and vigilant,
sensual, (aversive or cruel) thinking arose in me. I understood thus:
‘This class of thinking leads to my affliction, to others’ affliction,
and the affliction of both; it obstructs wisdom, sides with
difficulties, and leads away from Nibbāna.’ When I considered this, that
type of thinking subsided in me; Whenever sensual, (aversive or cruel)
thinking arose in me, I abandoned it, tamed it, and brought it to an
end…</p>
<p>…Bhikkhus, whatever a bhikkhu frequently thinks(vitakka) and ponders
upon(vicara), will become the inclination of his mind. If he frequently
thinks and ponders upon sensuality, he has abandoned the thought of
non-sensuality to cultivate the thought of sensuality, and then his mind
inclines to sensual thinking. If he frequently thinks and ponders with
aversion, he has abandoned thinking with non-aversion…or if he
frequently thinks and ponders with cruelty, he has abandoned thinking
with non-cruelty,…and as such his mind inclines to those unwholesome
directions.</p>

<p><strong>Recollection versus Concentration</strong></p>
<p>How is <em>recollection</em> different from concentration? What is
concentration in mundane terms?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> It’s all about honing in on something specific at
the expense of everything else. For example, playing the piano or being
completely immersed in something that absorbs all your attention. The
piano is something you have to focus on, and if you lose focus for a
moment, you’ll make a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Basically, it’s all about paying attention to
what’s in front of you. Does that differ from recollection and
composure?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Yes, because concentration depends on the object
that you are focused on.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> How? Where is the dependence? Because you could
not care what you are concentrating on, but practice concentration on,
for example, anything that comes into your field of attention.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> It depends on that object staying the same and
not going away. Because if you are concentrating on anything that comes
into your field of attention then you wouldn’t call that concentration,
because it would be diverse. It would be any type of object.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> But that’s my point. Does it matter what object
it is in order to define concentration? Concentration is what you do.
So, you could concentrate on any object that comes your way, and still
practice concentration. Even if there are different objects. Can you
concentrate on ‘themes’ or the nature of things?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> So, what’s the difference then?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Concentrating</em> is paying sole attention
to a thing. Whereas <em>recollection</em> is more about discerning the
background or context of one’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> You could say, in mundane terms, that when you
concentrate, you are doing it, you are intentionally attending to a
specific thing. But when you are recollecting, you are remembering the
context in which a thing has presently arisen. You are not doing that
context, you are remembering it, as opposed to concentration which is an
act that you choose to do, which is at the expense of the bigger picture
- the context. Concentration is concerned with content, whereas
recollection is the discernment of context.</p>
<p>Recollection then is not about trying to focus on something
particular. But rather about remembering certain contexts so that the
mind becomes composed in them.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Developing such composure is done
<em>indirectly</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Exactly. By recollecting certain contexts the
mind will be encouraged in a specific direction. For example, seeing the
danger and lack of satisfaction of attending in the wrong direction. If
you sustain these themes, then the mind will turn away from the wrong
direction. And why can’t you do that with concentration? Why can’t you
just concentrate on your mind and make it go that way?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Because it’s not an object that you can attend
to.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Exactly. Some people think that they can
concentrate on their mind. However, you don’t see your mind when you’re
concentrating <em>with</em> it. It’s not a sense object.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> It’s always <em>before</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Exactly. In the same sense, if I were to be
looking at visual things, I couldn’t see my eyes there. That is
impossible. Or feeling tactile sensations, to see my body there. That is
impossible. The body is the background. The body is the organ because of
which you sense sensations.</p>
<p>Do you think concentration can be helpful in practice?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Initially it is needed for reading the Suttas and
getting information.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Sure, attending to the right things is
important. However, I’m referring to concentration as a practice. Is
that beneficial?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Yes. If the mind is inclining toward unwholesome
things, it could be helpful to intentionally direct it toward more
wholesome things.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> When one is concentrated, is it possible to
discern what is wholesome or not?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Some things are obviously unwholesome.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> But while being concentrated, do you have the
possibility of discerning whether you are attending to something
wholesome or not?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Not by virtue of concentration. If you could, it
would be at the expense of concentration.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> What is the point at which attention becomes a
concentration practice?……when recollection is lost.</p>
<p>You have no choice but to attend to things. Nevertheless, you can
learn not to over-attend and overlook the context, meaning, and
background of whatever you are currently attending. The background is
where your intentions are. And that context is what tells you what is
wholesome (I can allow it to be attended further) or unwholesome (I
should not welcome it, not delight in it, and make sure I don’t attend
particular signs and features that will increase these states).
Attending only to the content means ignoring the context. So, ironically
the concentration practice is directly opposite to the <em>samadhi</em>
practice. The <em>composition</em> of the context is <em>samadhi</em>.
Recollecting things rightly, that then sustains and inclines your mind
in a certain way. Concentration means overshooting the mark and
abandoning the context - even if it’s concentrating on good things.
That’s why the whole practice is to learn how not to overshoot
(concentrate) or undershoot (ignore, deny). Attend to something, but
don’t let it become a focusing concentration practice, because you
cannot possibly do that and at the same time discern the background
context of your intentionality, the meaning, and the mood behind all of
that.</p>
<p><strong>Right Recollections, Right Composures</strong></p>
<p>Can you give some examples of the right composure and right
recollection?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Seeing the body as the present background
context, whatever one is doing.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> How would you see that?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Don’t be too involved in what you are doing.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> What constitutes ‘too involved’?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Concentration</em> in the way we just
described.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> So, abstaining from concentration. Would that
then reveal the background?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Not necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> So, back to my original question. How do I
reveal the context or background?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> As the Suttas say, be aware of what you are
doing. Not in the sense of the actual object of activity that you are
doing, but what your body is doing in general. In the sense that ‘I’m
sitting’, ‘I’m walking’, ‘I’m lying down’, ‘I’m standing’ – as a way to
indirectly notice the fact that, no matter what you’re engaged with,
your body is always there as the background image.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> How would I prevent that from becoming my
concentration object?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> To understand that the body we are talking about
now cannot be seen as a sense object.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes, so how do you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Frequently reflect and ponder on it.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> And to frequently reflect and ponder on it, what
do I need?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> To not forget the theme.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Where do I get the theme from?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> From studying the Discourses.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes. You learn about the themes that counter
your whole experience. The normal tendency is to attend to what’s right
in front of you. That’s the definition of sensuality in general. Your
<em>being</em> existing on the level of sense objects. That’s the
measure of what’s real. So then whatever you come across, you make it an
object by overly attending it - <em>Ayoniso manasikara</em>.</p>
<p>In this case, you’ll learn the right things, but you’ll still make
them objects of your attention. By studying, hearing, recollecting,
discerning, and reclarifying, however, you will be learning how not to.
Consequently, you need to abandon all of your wrong views (that require
certain degrees of attention, concentration, assumptions of sense
objects, etc.) to maintain the right composure, and the right
establishment of the mind. The right view is therefore essential. So,
we’re back to what we always say. Without the right view, you cannot get
the right <em>samadhi</em> because it isn’t a technique. You cannot
become accomplished in it by following a set of mechanical instructions.
It’s the discernment of and anchoring in the right context, the right
mood. The mood of a neutral feeling that’s not perturbed by pleasant or
unpleasant, by agreeable or disagreeable.</p>
<p>When you study the Suttas, you will be able to get a better sense of
context and themes. It won’t take that much study to see that that’s
what the Buddha was often talking about.</p>
<p>How do you incline your mind towards wholesome and take it away from
unwholesome? Not by watching your belly movements, nostrils, or the
soles of your feet. But through your active thinking and reflection, you
sustain these values by pondering on potential dangers, potential
perils, lack of satisfaction, and benefits. That’s what the first
<em>jhana</em> is - a comprehension born of active thinking and
pondering that is fully withdrawn, separated, and gone beyond
sensuality.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> It takes effort to understand what the Suttas are
genuinely saying. You have to be willing to question your assumptions
about these things because you start from a position of ignorance and
wrong view. Everything is misunderstood. One has to consider that there
is another way to pay attention to things, a peripheral attention.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes. It is learning how to attend correctly
because you start by over-attending everything. Or not attending what
you need to attend. Either ignoring or over-attending. The Middle ground
of it is awareness of attention and its context, its origin, its womb
(<em>yoniso</em>). That needs to be discerned and learned first;
sustained; endured; and then recognized for what it is. And then, yes,
you can cultivate it. But even then, it won’t become an object of your
cultivation, in that concentration sense. Even though, in the broadest
theoretical sense, yes – it’s a phenomenon, a theme, an object that you
can think about.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> It’s an <em>indirect</em> way. Not directly
wanting to change what is in front of you but changing the context.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes, you guide or encourage your mind to follow
certain paths. Just like you can create pathways for the water to flow
in a specific direction.</p>
<p><strong>Right Context</strong></p>
<p>What are some examples of the right context?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The danger of craving or sensuality. The benefit
of restraint and virtue.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes, it is important to repeatedly consider the
dangers of non-virtue, sensuality, and ill-will, even if you are
virtuous and sense-restrained. That’s how you’ll cultivate those right
themes. As far as external actions are concerned, there is nothing more
you need to do. You don’t need to be adding new rules and random
observances. By actively thinking about certain themes, one cultivates
the right <em>samadhi</em> based on unbroken virtue. Setting the mind on
the right path.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Recollecting your virtue and experiencing the joy
of that, the body becomes calm, and the mind becomes happy. That is the
composure that leads to knowledge and vision.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Exactly. Your body will become calm and
agreeable as your mind is calmed and made agreeable by having directed
it to certain moods and themes. <em>Samadhi</em> then is a result of the
right recollection, right thinking, and right evaluation - right
<em>vitakka</em> and <em>vicara</em>. And anyone can sit for periods of
each day, and make their mind think about these themes and values. If
you spend a few days building that up, the right mood will begin to
persist and gather momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Losing Composure</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Let’s say somebody says something to you and you
get angry. In frustration, you lose your <em>samadhi</em>. How should
you proceed?</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> The first recognition is that if you got
actively angry, you didn’t have samadhi in the first place. If you were
cultivating these themes and actively reflecting upon them, you wouldn’t
give in when anger arises. And you would see that difference now. If you
have gone on a long-distance mental journey in a good direction (of
non-anger) and somebody from a bad direction comes and tries to entice
you. Yes, it might make you turn around and start walking a bit in that
direction. But it’s still quite a walk to go back into the bad domain -
actively getting angry. And you will see that.</p>
<p>You will gain confidence because of that, thinking, “I don’t need to
panic and start fighting with the mind. Yes, it got a bit distracted.
However, let me endure this thing that’s trying to take my attention
through sensuality or anger and, instead, keep cultivating the same
indirect themes, cultivations, and contexts.” The further the mind goes
in that direction of abandonment and seclusion from the unwholesome, the
harder it will be to get disturbed by things that are at a vast distance
away. So, if you have spent a few days thinking about these contexts and
you still end up angry over something, it means you need to spend more
time cultivating the right context. Each time you develop the right
reflection and recollection – constantly thinking about those values –
the mind is travelling a little further in a good direction, and it will
continue to do so for as long as your virtue and sense restraint remain
unbroken.</p>
<p>You have to resist the urge to deal with your anger head-on. Because
that will require abandoning the context and entangling yourself in the
content to try to get rid of it. That’s why I keep saying that most
contemporary meditation practices are rooted in aversion and sensuality.
Trying to get rid of things that bother you and replacing it with a
sense pleasure - ‘antidoting’ this with that. Which requires you to
abandon the context or not have it to begin with.</p>
<p>This is how you protect your <em>samadhi</em>. Recognizing where the
importance lies. Reflecting on what you value. Thinking about the
dangers of losing those values and having the mind return to states that
are unbeneficial. Remembering all the joy, lightness, and clarity you
got as a result of establishing the right mood. Recollecting the fact
that the things that used to make you furious or lustful haven’t moved
you now, and if you forget about that, your mind will slowly drift back
into those unwholesome domains. Unless, of course, those impurities have
been fully uprooted.</p>
<p>There is no need to fight things directly. All you need is virtue,
sense restraint, solitude, and an active practice of thinking about and
reevaluating these wholesome themes. And when that practice becomes dry
and the mind starts getting distracted, it’s not about finding something
new to do. It’s about finding ways to rekindle the same things – until
the mind has travelled far enough away from unwholesome pastures and
burnt all bridges whereby it’s impossible to return.</p>
