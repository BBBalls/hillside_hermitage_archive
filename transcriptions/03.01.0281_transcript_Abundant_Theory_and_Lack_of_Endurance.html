<p><strong>Q:</strong> In terms of <span
lang="pi"><em>anatta</em></span>—a regular person acknowledges their
mortality and realizes that they don’t have full control over their
body. However, they still take things personally and view their body as
their own, even though they know they will die.</p>
<p><strong>Ajahn Nyanamoli:</strong> Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> It’s because of their behavior. Their actions
reflect the belief that they have control.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Exactly. You can have all the right ideas, but
if your behavior doesn’t align with those ideas, you’re reinforcing
incorrect assumptions. So, even though you understand in theory the
nature of existence, your habits and carelessness lead you towards
sensuality, resisting discomfort, overindulging in food, and in general
failing to restrain your senses. That’s where your wrong views are being
sustained. Your actions are in line with a sense of entitlement,
control, and the idea that you will live forever, despite your beliefs
being different. So, you need to act on your right ideas. You need to
start purifying your behavior to mirror those ideas.</p>
<p>There were, as it states in the <span lang="pi">Suttas</span>, <span
lang="pi">sāmanas</span>, and <span lang="pi">brahmins</span> outside of
the Buddha’s teaching who also had some right ideas that they
cultivated, for example:</p>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<p>‘I am not anything belonging to anyone anywhere, nor is there
anything belonging to me in anyone anywhere.’</p>
<p>— <cite>AN 4.185</cite></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<p><span lang="pi">Bhikkhu</span>s, of views held by outsiders, this is
the foremost, namely: ‘I might not be and it might not be mine; I shall
not be, and it will not be mine.’</p>
<p>— <cite>AN 10.29</cite></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>They realized that things are quite circumstantial, including the
sense of control. It can end at any moment. And the Buddha said that
that is the foremost of the outsiders’ views. The point was that, if you
do not just think that view once a month, but start, whenever you want
to act towards the world, towards him, her, or this, or that, you put
that view first: “_I am not anything belonging to anyone anywhere, nor
is there anything belonging to me in anyone anywhere, or ‘I might not be
and it might not be mine; I shall not be, and it will not be mine._’”
And by doing so you would not be able to engage in passion, aversion, or
distraction.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> For example, I might logically reason that
feelings are not mine because they’re subject to change. I can see that
and it kind of mirrors that right view in theory. I understand in theory
that it’s impermanent, or inaccessible to my control. And now, as I feel
pain, what do I do?</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Are you trying to get rid of it or are you
unmoved by it? Inevitably, you’ll be trying to get rid of it by using
those ideas of <span lang="pi"><em>anicca</em></span> etc. But, if you
then really start to understand those ideas, you realize, thinking about
the <span lang="pi">Dhamma</span> does not mean that’s the <span
lang="pi">Dhamma</span>. So you can have all the right ideas, but if
you’re not applying them rightly, there is no <span
lang="pi">Dhamma</span> there. And that’s important to recognize because
otherwise, you can easily slip into a view of ‘Well, as long as I think
about the <span lang="pi">Dhamma</span>, I am on the path’. But you’re
not. You’re on the path when you become a <span
lang="pi"><em>sotāpanna</em></span>. That’s the beginning of the path.
If you don’t see the <span lang="pi">Dhamma</span>, it means you don’t
see the path. How can you be on the path if you don’t see the path? And
you will not become a <span lang="pi"><em>sotāpanna</em></span> just on
account of such ideas. You need to start applying them, and enduring
things on the right level.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> So you could say feelings are not mine…</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Great, in theory, you’ve got it. So what do you
do? Let’s say there is a prospect of pleasure. What do you do in the
face of the prospect of pleasure?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I don’t delight in it.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> And what else? Do you act towards it? Follow
it?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> No, I endure it.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> For how long?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Forever.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Exactly. So, if those are the truths that you
understood, that you accepted, that you intellectually verified as
correct, now you start doing it. This feeling is not mine…It’s not in my
control, it’s a trap, it’s suffering…</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> But say in the beginning, I am faced with
feeling, a feeling is pressuring me, it’s touching me, it seems like
mine. But I have the outside view of the Buddha saying that it’s not-
mine…</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> It seems like yours, but there is an option
there. Do you accept the pressure as yours or as not-mine ? It is
presented as yours, as for you, but that doesn’t mean you have to accept
that at face value. It’s similar to how a fisherman casts a baited hook,
tempting the fish to bite. The bait is presented as something beneficial
for the fish to take, but ultimately it’s meant to hook and trap it. You
might not see that trap immediately, but at least you know, as long as I
don’t take this, I won’t be hooked.</p>
<p>Overall it’s important to recognize that <span
lang="pi">Dhamma</span> begins with <span
lang="pi"><em>sotāpatti</em></span>, not with the ideas of <span
lang="pi">Dhamma</span>, and even the clarity you might have. Because if
you do, you will be creating that discrepancy between your ideas that
you’re convinced are putting you on the path of <span
lang="pi">Dhamma</span>, and your behavior that is still not matching
it. Your lack of endurance, your lack of recognition on that right
level, lack of restraint regarding the need to manage discomfort and
unpleasant things. But if you don’t have such a view, and you recognize
‘Yes, these ideas, as clear and as pleasing as they are, they might be
very right, and I might verify later on that I was spot on right from
the start. But the only way I’ll do that is not through holding these
views about the ideas and so on, and feeling safe on account of it. No,
let me now apply those views in regard to sensuality, aversion, and
distraction.’ Only three things. You don’t need to seek verification
anywhere else.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> That’s the only way you will ever be able to
verify the <span lang="pi">Dhamma</span>. Because I can have a view, and
you can agree with my view. We can both agree that feelings are not
self…</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> … and we can write scholarly papers on it,
dissertations, and pages and pages of references, and create a whole
network of information. But that’s not the <span
lang="pi">Dhamma</span>. That’s the information about the <span
lang="pi">Dhamma</span>. <span lang="pi">Dhamma</span> is when things
are endured on the right level.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> So, I understand that feelings are not my own.
They don’t belong to me. They just come and go.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Great. Now, when things come and go, let them
come and go without acting out of them, without trying to get rid of
them, without delighting in them, without welcoming them.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> And keep doing that.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> For as long as it takes. And it might take
forever.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The verification that it has worked, is the fact
that feelings no longer pressure you.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Eventually, yes. The pressure felt will
diminish. There will be no pressure in the end. That’s why <span
lang="pi"><em>phassa</em></span> - pressure, can not pressure the
groundless one when there is no ground to apply that pressure. An <span
lang="pi">Arahant</span> is unable to experience pressure of any kind
anymore, mentally. He’s beyond pressure, nothing can pressure him.</p>
