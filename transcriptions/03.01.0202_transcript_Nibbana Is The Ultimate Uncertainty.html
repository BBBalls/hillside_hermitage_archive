<p>Colloquially speaking, if something is determined it implies
certainty and undetermined implies uncertainty. The highest undetermined
thing is <em>Nibbana</em>, the phenomenon of <em>asankhata dhamma</em>.
So from the point of view of an ignorant <em>putthujjana’s</em> mind
which depends on certainty, on <em>nicca</em>, on permanence, on taking
things personally, <em>Nibbana</em> is the ultimate uncertainty, the
most frightening thing. However, uncertainty is frightening only if you
still take certainty for granted and ‘put it first’ (i.e you see it in
the wrong order, rather than seeing that certainty is sought after only
because of the basis of uncertainty which is first), you think that
things are nicca and only occasionally <em>anicca</em> without realizing
that they are always <em>anicca</em>.</p>
<p>Sometimes when people understood the Nibbana that the Buddha taught,
they would become distraught, overcome with fear, because for them, that
Nibbana meant death or that which would destroy them.</p>
<p>Alagaddūpama Sutta (MN 22):</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Venerable sir, can there be agitation about what is non-existent
internally?”</p>
<p>“There can be, bhikkhu,” the Blessed One said. “Here, bhikkhu,
someone has the view: ‘That which is the self is the world; after death
I shall be permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change; I
shall endure as long as eternity.’ He hears the Tathāgata or a disciple
of the Tathāgata teaching the Dhamma for the elimination of all
standpoints, decisions, obsessions, adherences, and underlying
tendencies, for the stilling of all determinations, for the
relinquishing of all attachments, for the destruction of craving, for
dispassion, for cessation, for Nibbāna. He thinks thus: ‘So I shall be
annihilated! So I shall perish! So I shall be no more!’ Then he sorrows,
grieves, and laments, he weeps beating his breast and becomes
distraught. That is how there is agitation about what is non-existent
internally.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Thus you have to train your mind so that the uncertainty of
undetermined Nibbana, the dispassion of Nibbana will be the highest
bliss rather than the foremost terror. You can do that by first
cultivating virtue and sense restraint, and then if you want a
contemplation theme that will approximate Nibbana, you can use the
phenomenon of uncertainty. Examples of such contemplations can be found
in the suttas:</p>
<p>Udāna Sutta (SN 22:55), and in Āneñja-sappāya Sutta (MN 106):</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it
will not be mine. I am giving up what exists, what has come to be.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Maraṇassati Sutta (AN 6:19):</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Therefore you should train yourselves: ‘We will dwell heedfully. We
will develop mindfulness of death acutely for the sake of ending the
defilements.’ That is how you should train yourselves.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The main characteristic of those contemplations is the recognition of
that fundamental context of your existence which is always ‘uncertain’.
You don’t have to fabricate that truth, you just need to find it and
remember it, and that’s actually why you can sustain mindfulness on it
because it’s always true.</p>
<h4 id="uncertainty-is-always-in-the-background.">Uncertainty Is Always
In The Background.</h4>
<p>If you want to contemplate the phenomenon of <em>Nibbana</em> even as
a <em>puthujjana</em>, then contemplate uncertainty, as in, start
feeling it, contemplate that ‘your self is fully caged within
Uncertainty’ (which is the ‘right order of appearance). The tendency for
many people who try to practice <em>anicca</em>, is that they try to
determine the uncertainty in things ’over there’, which means you are
then just determining that which is undetermined. So when people go
around saying that “everything out there is impermanent”, that is true,
but that’s not the <em>anicca</em> which matters. <em>Anicca</em> that
matters is on the level of your existence, and if you understood it, you
wouldn’t be able to just say that your body is <em>anicca</em> and still
be equally as ignorant and passionate as before. If you see that your
body, your existence is uncertain, you will feel the threat of that
fact. That’s why <em>sila</em> needs to be established beforehand
because most minds would not be able to bear the recognition of what
<em>Nibbana</em> is. If the mind is strong enough on account of virtue,
it will not get distraught in the face of that fundamental uncertain
nature.</p>
<p>Everyone can feel that uncertainty, however, for an untrained mind it
will feel like anxiety but for the trained mind that got used to it,
recognized, and understood uncertainty, such a mind will be at peace,
because the anxious aspect of uncertainty is due to ignorance of it.</p>
<h4 id="enduring-a-feeling-is-unavoidable">Enduring A Feeling Is
Unavoidable</h4>
<p>All you need to do is start practicing sense restraint and that will
enable you to ‘endure feelings’ which is not optional, the only optional
thing is HOW you endure it. From the start, your whole life is about
trying to get rid of or get hold of feelings, and you do all that based
on having to endure those feelings. But if you practice sense restraint
and endure it on those terms, you still have to endure it, but the
benefit is that it can result in wisdom. That’s why the Buddha said:</p>
<p>Salayatana-vibhanga Sutta (MN 137):</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“By depending &amp; relying on the six kinds of renunciation joys,
abandon &amp; transcend the six kinds of household joys. Such is their
abandoning, such is their transcending. By depending &amp; relying on
the six kinds of renunciation distress, abandon &amp; transcend the six
kinds of household distress. Such is their abandoning, such is their
transcending. By depending &amp; relying on the six kinds of
renunciation equanimity, abandon &amp; transcend the six kinds of
household equanimity. Such is their abandoning, such their
transcending.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>You replace one type of feeling with another because feelings are not
optional. Whether it’s the feeling of the householder or the renunciant,
a feeling will have to be there, you are subjected to it and you will
have to endure it. So that’s why the WAY of endurance that you choose is
important. Will it be the way of welcoming, resisting, denying, or the
middle way, the way of not acting out of craving?</p>
<h4 id="the-undetermined-feeling">The Undetermined Feeling</h4>
<p>When one KNOWS a neutral feeling, it is then recognized as superior
to a pleasant feeling, because pleasure pressures you to get more and
pain pressures you to get rid of it. But with a neutral feeling, it is
undetermined. You are undetermined and not pressured in a neutral
feeling. The only problem with a neutral feeling is when you do NOT KNOW
it. It’s your ignorance of the neutral feeling that then pressures you
toward distraction and delusion:</p>
<p>Cūḷa Vedalla Sutta (MN 44):</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Pleasant feeling is pleasant when it remains and painful when it
perishes. Painful feeling is painful when it remains and pleasant when
it perishes. <em>Neutral feeling is pleasant when known, and painful
when not-known.</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>If you want to know and benefit from the neutral feeling you have to
start restraining the delight in pleasure and stop trying to get rid of
the pain by default. When you see the value in the neutral, you will see
the value in uncertainty, in neither agreeable-or-disagreeable, the
value in non-disturbance, the value in dispassion, in disenchantment,
which most people do not see. For most people, passion is seen as good,
it provides you with the drive for life, and that’s true, that’s the
householder’s joy, but to have that joy you must also be blind to the
implicit danger in that thing that you are passionate about, because if
you become aware of the danger, then you will realize that it’s not
worth clinging to or valuing, so then letting go is not a choice. When
you realize that your passion is a trap, you automatically don’t want
it. The only time you get trapped by a trap is when you don’t see it as
a trap.</p>
<p>So contemplate being within uncertainty not as an object of your
attention but as the background of your experience as a whole. Start
seeing the characteristics of uncertainty, and if you develop in that
way, you will force your mind to become dispassionate, and that’s when
the mind starts seeing clearly when the clouds of passion disappear.</p>
<h4 id="the-context-of-the-uncertain-body">The Context Of The Uncertain
Body</h4>
<p><em>Sabbe Sankhara Anicca</em>- all determinations are uncertain. If
determinations are uncertain then what is to be said about the things
that the determinations determine. They are even more uncertain. So,
<em>sabbe SANKHARA anicca, sabbe SANKHARA dukkha</em>, all
determinations are uncertain and unsatisfactory, thus sabbe DHAMMA
anatta - everything that is determined cannot be owned.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, determinations (<em>sankhara</em>) are things
that are the basis for your ownership. For example, let’s say you are
attached to your house and family, the joy that you get on account of
those things is determined by having the house and family. You can then
say, if you are attached to your family, the presence of both yours and
their bodies are now the basis for the entire emotional relationship
that you have with your family, all the joys and griefs. Those emotional
experiences would not be there if the body was not there, so the
fundamental determination is the body. That’s why if one maintains the
context of the body as the necessary basis for any experience in your
life, with the recognition of Uncertainty of that determination/ that
context, then whatever you experience based on that uncertain, unstable
bodily context, is unownable. So your family will still be there and
perceived but now the emotional basis for your ownership is gone because
it’s seen based on uncertainty.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of training to develop that level of clarity regarding
the context of the body as a determination for everything. Most people
wouldn’t see that connection, they wouldn’t see that the presently
enduring body is that which determines all of their emotional joys and
griefs that they get from some event in the world. If a person sees that
the main characteristic of their body is uncertainty then it doesn’t
matter what comes their way, they wouldn’t get emotionally upset because
they cannot forget the container of uncertainty in which this is all
happening. A great example of this is found in:</p>
<p>Nandamātar Sutta (AN 7.50):</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t have only that amazing &amp; astounding quality, venerable
sir. I have another amazing &amp; astounding quality. I had an only son:
Nanda, dear &amp; appealing. The rulers seized &amp; abducted him on
some pretext and had him executed. But when the boy had been arrested or
was being arrested, when he had been imprisoned or was being imprisoned,
when he had been killed or was being killed, I don’t recall any
alteration of my mind.”</p>
<p>“It’s amazing, Nandamātar! It’s astounding, that you can purify even
as little as the arising of a thought.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The mind that is established upon the undetermined, upon the
uncertain as the fundamental non-negotiable basis, the Nibbana, will not
resist the uncertainty because doing so is still within the
uncertainty.</p>
<p>Your sense of self needs to have these determinations that you
blindly take ownership of. The point to consider here, it’s not about
throwing away your possessions, but instead find things that you do own
and through that sense of ownership start discerning the uncertainty of
that thing. Initially, that will be felt anxiously, but once the mind is
developed you will not suffer much on account of that anxiety, however,
it’s still the same route that you have to go down if you want to
develop Nibbana.</p>
<h4 id="the-one-and-only-path">The One And Only Path</h4>
<p>Vitthara Sutta (AN 4.162):</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Monks, there are these four modes of practice. Which four? Painful
practice with slow understanding, painful practice with quick
understanding, pleasant practice with slow understanding, &amp; pleasant
practice with quick understanding..”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Either way, it’s the same path that needs to be walked, through the
sense of ownership which is present you need to discern the uncertainty,
and the mind which has developed samadhi will not be moved by that
uncertainty, relatively speaking. Samadhi is not measured by how
peaceful or blissful your meditation session was until the bell rang,
it’s measured by how much you don’t move in the face of uncertainty,
sensuality, pain, misfortune, etc. How much is your mind scraping at the
walls to outrun the pain, or how much is it like a mountain that cannot
be moved? Being immovable is <em>samadhi</em>. The beginning of the
right <em>samadhi</em> is not being moved by the five hindrances or by
the joys and griefs regarding the world. If you develop that, it’s the
<em>samadhi</em> of <em>jhana</em>.</p>
<p>Most people hope that if they do some technique of watching the
breath and so on, they will get into <em>jhana</em> and then they will
not be bothered by the hindrances or moved by the joys and griefs of the
world, but as you can see, you have to do the work of not moving on
account of the joys, griefs, and hindrances first and then the result
will be the pleasure of the seclusion, which is where <em>jhana</em> is.
The measure of samadhi is the immovability regarding any pressure
whether positive or negative, but it’s usually negative.</p>
<p>If you have no sila, you have no samadhi and will be completely
overwhelmed if you understand what <em>Nibbana</em> is. The Buddha’s
teaching will terrify you, because from the <em>putthajjanas</em> point
of view, “it is the death of me” and it is. If you invest the effort in
sila, through such endurance you will be developing
<em>samadhi</em>.</p>
<p>The necessary <em>samadhi</em> will be born from the work of your
sila, sense restraint, abandoning the joys and griefs, and your
cultivation of the context of uncertainty. In that way, you will force
your mind to compose, which will have to result in clear seeing.</p>
