<p>Ask yourself can you stop your feelings? Can you stop your form/rupa
from deteriorating? Can you prevent perceptions from besetting you? Can
you not choose?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is samsara?</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Samsara is usually translated as rebirth but it
literally means “wandering on” ( to move about continuously). It’s a
translation which makes the meaning clearer because rebirth implies this
life, the next life, and an in-between place which is just me passing
through from one life to another. However, you are not being reborn,
it’s more like you ‘still are’ just here and there continuously on and
on.</p>

<p>“Again, Udāyi, I have declared this method to my disciples. Fallen to
this method my disciples could recollect the various manifold previous
births. Such as one birth, two births, three, four, five, ten, twenty,
thirty, forty, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a
hundred thousand births, an innumerable forward cycle of births, and an
innumerable backward cycle of births and an innumerable forward and a
backward cycle of births. There I was of such name, clan, disposition,
supports, experiencing these pleasant and unpleasant feelings and in
such a life span. Disappearing from there was born here, with such name,
clan, disposition, supports, and experiences, feeling these pleasant and
unpleasant feelings in such a life span. Disappearing from there is born
here. Thus they recollect the various manifold previous births. Udāyi,
it is like a man who would go from his village to another village, and
from there would go to another village, and would come back to his own
village: and it would occur to him. I went from my village to that
village, there I stood thus, sat thus, said this and kept silence thus.
From that village I went to the next village, there I stood thus, sat
thus, said this, and kept silence thus. From that village, I came back
to my village. In the same manner, I have declared the method to my
disciples fallen to which, my disciples could recollect the various
manifold births such as one birth, two births----Thus recollect the
various manifold previous births…”</p>

<p>You are here now and then you are somewhere else without these
memories and recognitions, but similar aggregates and point of view,
it’s just a wandering on, like you go to sleep and wake up another day,
then you go to sleep and you wake up like an animal. I’m overly
simplifying it but only because sometimes reflecting on samsara can have
an impact on people, in the sense it brings up a sense of urgency
regarding the practice because if you speak about rebirth it sounds like
it’s just out of your hands, it’s just how the universe works, you just
come and go here and there, but the birth itself is not the
beginning.</p>
<p>Imagine now for instance if someone were to offer you to restart this
life, go back and become a toddler without being able to keep all of
your memories of everything that you have been through, that all has to
be erased, would you go through the same ordeal again, just in this life
that you already know, let alone in a realm that you are not familiar
with? When you think about it, you realize that the appeal would only be
if you can keep your memories and then you can restart the same life
again, and that’s really how many people think about rebirth as though
they take things with them and just better themselves through rebirth,
but no, it’s just a memory-erasing but you are still there, as though
someone were to wipe your memories and you start again without the
knowledge from your previous experiences. Would you want to do it again?
It would make you think twice because you might make even worse choices
than you already have. In a nostalgic hindsight, your experiences of
your daily pressures can seem quite pleasant but when it’s there it’s
never pleasant.</p>
<p>The Buddha said, there is nothing that you haven’t been already.
Beings have been samsara for so long they have been everything, a
mother, a father, a killer, the killed, every animal, etc. The tedious
repetition that you have no memory of is basically what samsara is. You
can realize that this life is already samsara, this is already that
wandering on, it’s one of many wanderings, and the actions you choose
which will be the directions in which you will wander on later. That is
why beings are the owners of their actions, the choices you make, and
the things you do determine in which direction you are headed.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is samsara something which encompasses us?</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> You are not in Samsara, it is not a universe
that you inhabit, it is your experience as a whole. What you have now is
what samsara is. In the same sense that you can recognize certain
tedious repetitions of day-to-day things, just extend that into
infinity, extend that into the next life and the next life, and so on,
perpetually just repeating because you forget. As the Buddha said, if
someone can remember their previous lives, their previous wanderings,
the directions that they have been in, all they will remember is these
five-assumed-aggregates that they have now. Those aggregates are your
experience as a whole, which is matter, feeling, perceptions,
activities/determinations, and consciousness, there is nothing outside
of that. Samsara is the aggregates which are bound with ignorance which
keeps being repeated until you make the effort to uproot that
ignorance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“…When recollecting thus, bhikkhus: ‘I had such a form in the past,’
it is just a form that one recollects. When recollecting: ‘I had such a
feeling in the past,’ it is just a feeling that one recollects. When
recollecting: ‘I had such a perception in the past,’ it is just a
perception that one recollects. When recollecting: ‘I had such
determinations in the past,’ it is just determinations that one
recollects. When recollecting: ‘I had such consciousness in the past,’
it is just consciousness that one recollects…”</p>

<p>– SN 22.79</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The content of one’s experience changes but the
general nature remains the same?</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> The content changes while the aggregates remain
the same and that’s the whole point. From that village to the next, the
point is that you are still wandering on, so it’s not metaphorically
speaking, samsara is already here, it is what this life already is, a
wandering on, I mean ask yourself, can you stop your feelings? Can you
stop your form from deteriorating? Can you prevent perceptions from
besetting you? Can you not choose? Can you just switch off your
consciousness? You have no say in these aggregates they are just coming
and going, taking directions. That’s already what samsara is. You don’t
need the belief or proof of next life because you are already not in
control of these aggregates and they are already taking directions that
often you don’t even want to go in and which forces you to have to
endure things. Right here is the samsara, you don’t get it more direct
than that. So yes, death is not the end, and birth is not the beginning,
it’s just like a rearrangement of the same thing, another way of
repeating it. You don’t need the memory of previous lives or a special
insight into future lives to see samsara as wandering on which is
something which you are already fully engaged with as we speak.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Samsara is something you are subjected to?</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes, you are doing it and you can’t just stop
it, because that would be another choice within the samsara, another
choice within the aggregate of sankhara. Can you not choose? Can you
abstain from not choosing without that being another choice? You can’t,
you are fully within it, so you have to do it. Can you not feel? Is that
even conceivable? Can you imagine your existence in the most abstract
terms without a form or a body or some kind of enduring thing there?
Impossible, inconceivable. You are fully under the weight and control of
the aggregates, you can’t stop them, you can’t tell your aggregates to
go this way or that way, but you can start making the choices of a
wholesome kind as opposed to an unwholesome kind, and in that indirect
manner improve the state of your situation.</p>
<p>If a person starts to practice sense restraint their mind will
develop more patience, more calmness, more self-composure and strength
and that’s already something which would make this wandering on in this
life much more endurable and agreeable as well. Is being impatient
pleasant or unpleasant? It’s very unpleasant when you want something
that you cannot get, or you don’t want something but you can’t get rid
of it and you have to endure it, you’re not patient. Is patience given
or do you develop it, either by circumstances forcing it upon you
whereby you have no choice or actually if you foresee it and start
making effort in the direction of developing patience? That’s just one
example, so by making choices of a wholesome kind in this life, by not
pursuing sensuality, not being careless, and disregarding others, not
being immoral, and harmful to others by making that effort to keep
yourself in check, you are developing patience, which means that the
endurance of this samsara you will be able to tolerate it even more, the
pressure as well, because you developed that tolerance. Tolerance needs
to be developed, it’s not a god-given quality. If you invest effort in
it, it will grow, if you don’t it will shrink, and then you will be even
more pulled by the desires and your wandering will be even faster and
more hectic, more distracted like an animal. And that’s why when a
rearrangement of this form occurs but your mind was pretty much a mind
of an animal, that’s the form that you are going to be assuming and
that’s what the Buddha said, if someone behaves like an animal in this
life, that’s going to be their destination.</p>
<p>The body is a means of engagement with the world and sense objects,
so what you chose to engage with, the way you choose to engage with your
body, that’s basically where your mind is heading, so next time you
might get a body which is more suitable for the level of engagement you
want or are choosing. If your mind was engaging with sense objects on
the level of animal passion, madness and thirst, then you are going to
get a body which is much more suited for that. That’s why dogs have a
smell much stronger than humans because that’s how much more they are
pulled by the sense objects. You might smell something nice but it won’t
make you lose your mind like a dog. If you don’t make the effort and
start giving in to losing your mind on account of sense objects, then
yes you will get a form which supports what you want, what you keep
choosing. If you develop choices which abstain from sense objects then
you don’t need sense organs, so when the rearrangement happens, so to
speak, you will get much fewer sense organs like in the suttas when the
Buddha describes the celestial type bodies which are more refined , you
would not call them bodies from our point of view.</p>
<p>And again future life, previous life doesn’t matter, what matters is
to recognize the nature of aimless wandering on and that the aim you
might have within that wandering on is fundamentally aimless, so even if
you have a great mundane purpose in this life, means it’s still mundane
and will not change the state of this aimless wandering on, your aim is
only relative and when the time comes for thing to rearrange, that aim
will make no difference, in other words, you cannot prevent the form
from deforming, getting sick and dying that’s inconceivable. You are on
borrowed time every time.</p>
<p>If you want to have a simplified example of what would correspond to
rebirth, it’s not about being born again or dying, it’s really about
losing the memory and that’s why beings are bound to constant repetition
of the same thing because they have no recognition of what they have
already done countless times. After all, if you remembered you would not
want to do it anymore, you would want to leave that state of affairs.
Imagine now that someone comes and wipes your memory, just the memory so
your body is still intact, you are still alive but your memory and
recognition of anything you know including yourself is gone. So for you,
if you were to wake up from that state, although others would externally
see that it’s the same person, the same body, but from your point of
view, the body and everything would be a new thing, yet it’s not a new
thing isn’t it? It’s a new thing from that internal point of view
because you have no memory of it and that’s exactly what rebirth is.
It’s just losing the memory and not realizing that the aggregates are
not yours and they never were.</p>
<p>Ignorance regarding it has no beginning and that’s why you should be
concerned about death and dying because everything you learn even the
wisdom you got unless it was of a significant kind will most likely not
play much part and then all you can do is to focus on doing wholesome
things because as I explained simply by cultivating certain habits in
the mind, when your memory is wiped clean you are going to start using
the body from the point of view of the habits you cultivated beforehand.
You don’t have explicit memories of the habits but the inclinations are
there and those inclinations you are responsible for. They are there
because you have been choosing those things many times before. It
doesn’t just mean that you now just carelessly give in to inclinations,
it just means that the presence of inclination is due to previous habits
which then also means that you could reshape them.</p>
<p>If your inclinations are bad, you can double down on doing good in
this life so that you develop good inclinations. So then in the next
manifestation, those inclinations will be what inclines you or directs
you without wisdom or memory to recall on. That’s really what rebirth in
samsara is, the repetition of habits without knowing that you are
repeating the same old habits.</p>
