<p>“And what, monks, is the right effort? (1) There is the case where a
monk generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds &amp;
exerts his intent for the sake of the [non-arising of evil, unskillful
qualities]{.underline} that have not yet arisen. (2) He generates
desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his
intent for the sake of the [abandonment of evil, unskillful

right effort.”</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the difference between desire-
<em>chanda</em> and craving- <em>tanha</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Nyanamoli:</strong> The difference is that
<em>chanda</em>-desire is a form of zeal, interest, and it can be either
wholesome or unwholesome. If you have a desire towards sensuality, that
is <em>kamachanda</em>-sensual desire, which is not a wholesome desire.
So then if you want to be free from sensuality because you started to
understand the dissatisfaction of it, then you can have a desire to be
free from it, to be free from sensuality and sensual desire. It’s still
a form of desire that can make you want to practice the Dhamma. It’s a
desire that can eventually result in freedom from sensual desire.
<em>Chanda</em> is not in itself bad, nor good, it just depends on where
you direct it. It’s not a question of not having desires as you begin to
practice. It’s really about having the desires that are directed at the
development of the wholesome and the diminishing of the unwholesome.</p>
<p>When you are free from any desire towards sensuality and so on, you
will also lose the desire towards the wholesome because that is now what
you are. At that point, you don’t need to have a desire to develop the
wholesome once that wholesome is developed. That’s how desire, directed
rightly, can result in freedom from desire all together, freedom from
<em>chanda</em> all together.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Then the brahmin Uṇṇābha approached the Venerable Ānanda… and
said:”For what purpose, Master Ānanda, is the holy life lived under the
ascetic Gotama?”</p>
<p>“It is for the sake of abandoning desire, brahmin, that the holy life
is lived under the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>“But, Master Ānanda, is there a path, is there a way for the
abandoning of this desire- <em>chanda</em>?”</p>
<p>“There is a path, brahmin, there is a way for the abandoning of this
desire.”</p>
<p>“But, Master Ānanda, what is the path, what is the way for the
abandoning of this desire?”</p>
<p>“Here, brahmin, a bhikkhu develops the basis for potency that
possesses composure due to desire- <em>chanda</em> and intentions of
striving. He develops the basis for potency that possesses composure due
to energy … composure due to mind … composure due to investigation and
intentions of striving. This, brahmin, is the path, this is the way for
the abandoning of this desire.”</p>
<p>“Such being the case, Master Ānanda, the situation is never ending,
there is no end. It is impossible that one can abandon desire by means
of desire itself.”</p>
<p>“Well then, brahmin, I will question you about this matter. Answer as
you see fit. What do you think, brahmin, did you earlier have the
desire, ‘I will go to the park,’ and after you went to the park, did the
corresponding desire subside?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“Did you earlier arouse energy, thinking, ‘I will go to the park,’
and after you went to the park, did the corresponding energy
subside?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“Did you earlier make up your mind, ‘I will go to the park,’ and
after you went to the park, did the corresponding resolution
subside?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“Did you earlier make an investigation, ‘Shall I go to the park?’ and
after you went to the park, did the corresponding investigation
subside?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“It is exactly the same, brahmin, with a bhikkhu who is an arahant,
one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what
had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, utterly
destroyed the fetters of existence, and is completely liberated through
final knowledge. He earlier had the desire for the attainment of
arahantship, and when he attained arahantship, the corresponding desire
subsided. He earlier had aroused energy for the attainment of
arahantship, and when he attained arahantship, the corresponding energy
subsided. He earlier had made up his mind to attain arahantship, and
when he attained arahantship, the corresponding resolution subsided. He
earlier made an investigation for the attainment of arahantship, and
when he attained arahantship, the corresponding investigation
subsided.</p>
<p>“What do you think, brahmin, such being the case, is the situation
never ending or is there an end?”</p>
<p>“Surely, Master Ānanda, such being the case, the situation has an
end, and is not never ending.</p>
<p>Magni cent, Master Ānanda!… From today let Master Ānanda remember me
as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>

<p>Abandoning unskilful desire is not a matter of choice, it’s a matter
of directing it towards a certain kind of behaviour, that kind being the
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn125"><em>gradual training</em>,</a>
which will then remove any basis for perpetuation of unskilful desire
later on.</p>
<p>In other words, when you become aware of your illness, you need to
have a desire to be cured. That desire will make you look for a doctor,
find the right medicine, and then sustain the application of the
medicine on the basis of desire for health. And then once you’re cured,
and healed, and there is absolutely not even the slightest trace of your
illness left, you will have no more desire to be cured because you’re
cured. However, if while you’re ill and you think, “Okay, so being free
from illness means having no desire to be cured, thus, I will have no
desire to be cured”, that way of thinking will prevent you from curing
yourself.</p>
<p>In the beginning, a person cannot distinguish between bad or good
desire. That’s why you need to start with sense restraint, as we always
say. But you don’t want to be trying to not have desires. You want to be
trying to see where your desires are directed. And if it’s a desire for
physical pleasures, of the lustful kind. That’s a desire you should not
cultivate, that’s the desire you should abandon, not welcome, not
entertain, endure until it passes without acting out of it.</p>
<p>An <em>anagami,</em> who is free from sensual desire, is not free
from <em>chanda</em>. He’s free from desire towards the sense objects of
pleasures. In other words, freedom from sensuality doesn’t mean absence
of <em>chanda</em> of any kind, it means loss of interest and zeal for
the sensual type of pleasure. Why? Because the gratification has been
fully understood, the danger has been fully understood and the escape
has been fully understood.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“That any brahmins or contemplatives who do not discern, as it
actually is, the gratification of sensuality as gratification, the
drawback of sensuality as drawback, the escape from sensuality as
escape, would themselves understand sensuality or would rouse another
with the truth so that, in line with what he has practiced, he would
understand sensuality: That is impossible. But that any brahmins or
contemplatives who discern, as it actually is, the gratification of
sensuality as gratification, the drawback of sensuality as drawback, the
escape from sensuality as escape, would themselves understand sensuality
or would rouse another with the truth so that, in line with what he has
practiced, he would understand sensuality: That is possible.”</p>

<p>It’s not that an <em>anagami</em> or an <em>arahant</em> have no
concept anymore of what physical pleasure would feel like, it’s that
they have no interest in it anymore on the level of the mind, intent or
thought. They’re absolutely free from any zeal that a person not free
from sensuality would otherwise have. An untrained person who has a
sensual thought, is immediately pressured to act out of that thought and
pursue sensual pleasures, because there exists an inclination towards
it, there is a welcoming of that prospect of pleasure, the possibility
of gratification.</p>
<p>That inclination can only be abandoned through seeing the danger of
that delighting towards sense objects.</p>
<p>You will not have an interest in ingesting poison if you understood
the deadliness of the poison. Even though the texture and taste of it
hasn’t changed, the pleasure hasn’t changed, but your understanding now
of seeing it as a poison, that has changed, and so you have absolutely
no zeal towards that kind of pleasure whatsoever. You have no interest
in it.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> A person might say, “Well, I understand that
sensuality is bad. Yet, I’m still attracted.”</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> For as long as you haven’t fully understood the
gratification, the danger and the escape, you will still value
sensuality, which means that you should not claim that you understood
sensuality. Because if you do make such a statement, that means you’re
contradicting yourself. If you fully understood those three aspects,
there would be no <em>chanda</em> towards sensuality left, there would
only be <em>chanda</em> towards renunciation, towards seclusion, towards
further abandonment.</p>
<p>A person might think, “Yes, I understand the peril of sensuality”.
Okay, fine. Ask yourself the next question.</p>
<p>“So am I free from any form of delight, welcoming, zeal, interest,
curiosity even towards pleasures that come on account of objects of the
senses that are provocative of lust?”. “No, I don’t think I’m free of
that. Or I’m not sure if I’m free that.”, that means you’re not free of
that, that means that you should not think you understood it, and that
you need to make more of an effort in the direction of
understanding.</p>
<p>Nobody denies that you will have some insight or some degree of
insight into sensuality once you start restraining, but don’t think
that’s freedom until you know, “I am free. I don’t want this, this is
truly something I have no interest in anymore, quite the opposite”.</p>
<p>You might spend most of your day not having interest in sensual
pursuits, but are you still liable to having interest in sensual
pursuits? If so, you’re not outside of the domain of sensual desire.</p>
<p>You always want to look at that level of <em>liability</em>, “Am I
liable to become careless and interested in sensual pursuits again? Well
, maybe?”. Well , there you go, you’re not free from doubt in regard to
it, which means you’re not free from it.</p>

<p>“…Then Ānanda said to the nun:</p>
<p>“Sister, this body is produced by food. Relying on food, you should
give up food. This body is produced by craving. Relying on craving, you
should give up craving. This body is produced by conceit. Relying on
conceit, you should give up conceit. This body is produced by sex. The
Buddha spoke of breaking o everything to do with sex.</p>
<p>‘This body is produced by food. Relying on food, you should give up
food.’ This is what I said, but why did I say it? Take a mendicant who
reflects properly on the food that they eat: ‘Not for fun, indulgence,
adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm,
and to support the holy life. In this way, I shall put an end to old
discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live
blamelessly and at ease.’ After some time, relying on food, they give up
food. That’s why I said what I said.</p>
<p>‘This body is produced by <em>tanha</em>-craving. Relying on craving,
you should give up craving.’ This is what I said, but why did I say it?
Take a mendicant who hears this: ‘They say that the mendicant named
so-and-so has realized the undefiled freedom of mind and freedom by
wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their
own insight due to the ending of defilements.’</p>
<p>They think: ‘Oh, when will I too realize the undefiled freedom of
mind and freedom by wisdom in this very life. …’ After some time,
relying on craving, they give up craving. That’s why I said what I
said.</p>
<p>‘This body is produced by conceit. Relying on conceit, you should

<p>‘Well, that venerable person can realize the undefiled freedom of
mind and freedom by wisdom in this very life. … Why can’t I?’ After some
time, relying on conceit, they give up conceit. That’s why I said what I

<p>As for <em>tanha</em>, it’s subtler than <em>chanda</em>.
<em>Tanha</em> is on a different level. <em>Chanda</em> is kind of an
active quality that you either carelessly engage with on account of your
past behaviour that hasn’t been restrained, or something you can
cultivate, as the Buddha would say, “he generates desire… for the sake
of the non-arising of evil, unskillful qualities that have not yet
arisen…”.</p>
<p>You can reflect on why it’s good to be cured, why it’s good to make
the effort towards abandoning the unwholesome and cultivating the
wholesome, why it’s good to practice the gradual training, why it’s good
to be virtuous and sense restraint, and because of those reflections you
will be generating a desire to develop those practices.</p>
<p><em>Tanha</em> is more on an immediate level of your attitude towards
your present enduring feeling, whatever it is.</p>
<p>That attitude is always rooted in <em>resistance</em>. If there is
craving for pleasure, that is rooted in you resisting the current
feeling, which is not necessarily unpleasant, but it’s not sufficient,
i.e. the pleasure, it’s not sufficient, which is why you crave for more
pleasure. Which means, it’s painful.</p>
<p>Any resistance is painful, and with the mind of resistance, if you
experience pleasure, you will by default be resisting it, because by
default, you want more of it. With the mind not free from
<em>tanha</em>, when you experience pain, by default you’re resisting
it, because you don’t want any of it. You want it to completely go away.
With the mind not free from <em>tanha</em>, when you experience a
neutral feeling, you will automatically resist it, you will incline
towards oblivion, towards ignoring it, towards turning away from it,
because you don’t understand it. <em>Tanha,</em> practically speaking,
is always that resistance on the level of what you’re currently
feeling.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Even if you’re feeling pleasure, you’re still
resisting it. It’s not good enough for you.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Absolutely. That’s why if you’re not free from
craving, every pleasure will be underlined by craving for more. With the
presence of resistance, there is the presence of dissatisfaction,
presence of <em>tanha</em> means <em>dukkha</em> is there, presence of
<em>dukkha</em> means <em>tanha</em> is there.</p>
<p>If <em>tanha</em> is still present, that means that there is still
resistance to whatever feeling is there for you at the time, and that’s
why you suffer, not because of what is felt but because of that
resistance. And why would you be resisting? Why is it that you’re not
content with an agreeable feeling that is present? Why is it, that by
default, the mind wants more of it? It’s because of the wrong view in
regard to what pleasure is, what sensuality is, what gratification is.
Sensuality is a form of <em>upadana</em>, an assumption, it’s a view,
it’s basically the values that you uphold throughout your day to day
existence.</p>
<p>Sensual desire is felt unpleasantly and that’s why you want to
gratify your senses, because non-gratified senses hurt. However, your
resistance is the suffering there, and so if you stop resisting the non
gratified senses, they’ll stop hurting and there will be no suffering
there despite the senses being gratified.</p>
<p>You don’t see that the suffering is on the level of your
<em>resistance</em>. You think suffering exists because there is no
gratification of the senses, and so you go out and seek gratification,
and that’s why you keep perpetuating your suffering.</p>
<p>First, you need to stop seeking out the gratification of the senses.
So that your <em>resistance</em> to the non-gratified senses becomes
apparent as the cause of your suffering. And then you realise, “Oh, I
stop resisting. It stops hurting”. Which means that gratifying the
senses becomes redundant.</p>
<p>The habit of resistance (craving) perpetuates the sensuality view
that non-gratified senses cause suffering and gratified senses means
freedom from suffering.</p>
<p><em>Tanha</em> feeds <em>kāmupādāna-</em> the assumption of sense
desire, and the <em>kāmupādāna</em> feeds <em>tanha</em>, that’s why
it’s beginningless. It’s a vicious circle, it has no beginning. It’s not
that you were pure, then you develop <em>tanha</em>, and then you
develop <em>upadana</em>. No, you start already infected, perverted,
mistaken, confused, assumed.</p>
<p>Corruption is beginningless. And that’s why if you understand it, if
you uproot the gratuitous assumption or the craving, both will be
uprooted and cannot revert back. The uprooting is irreversible.</p>
<p>Ignorance:</p>

kinds of misconduct, too, I say, have a nutriment; they are not without

of the sense faculties, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without

comprehension. Lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension, too, I say,
has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment
for lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension?</p>
<p>It should be said: “attention without the right perspective”-

<p><em>Ayonisomanasikara</em>, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not
without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for
<em>ayonisomanasikara</em>? It should be said: lack of faith. Lack of
