<p><strong>Q:</strong> Our recent discussions have centred around
cultivating the Brahmavihāras. From my perspective, it’s crucial to
differentiate and comprehend each of the four components of an
unobstructed <span lang="pi"><em>Brahmavihāra</em></span> mind—namely:
<span lang="pi"><em>mettā</em></span>, <span
lang="pi"><em>karuṇā</em></span>, <span
lang="pi"><em>muditā</em></span>, and <span
lang="pi"><em>upekkhā</em></span>—individually. But only after
establishing and stabilising <span lang="pi"><em>mettā</em></span>, can
one start discerning <span lang="pi"><em>karuṇā</em></span>, <span
lang="pi"><em>muditā</em></span>, and <span
lang="pi"><em>upekkhā</em></span> ‘one by one’.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Instead of saying that it’s developed ‘one by
one’ it is more accurate to say that it’s developed ‘one within the
other’. Through understanding what <span lang="pi"><em>mettā</em></span>
is, you understand the principle of all four <span
lang="pi"><em>Brahmavihāras</em></span>. Then within that understanding
and development of <span lang="pi"><em>mettā</em></span>, you can
develop <span lang="pi"><em>karuṇā</em></span>, and within <span
lang="pi"><em>karuṇā</em></span>, you get to build <span
lang="pi"><em>muditā</em></span>; which then results in the fulfilment
of <span lang="pi"><em>upekkhā</em></span>. You don’t abandon <span
lang="pi"><em>mettā</em></span> to develop <span
lang="pi"><em>karuṇā</em></span>, or <span
lang="pi"><em>karuṇā</em></span> to develop <span
lang="pi"><em>muditā</em></span>, nor do you leave all three to develop
<span lang="pi"><em>upekkhā</em></span>. <span
lang="pi"><em>Upekkhā</em></span> encompasses them all. But to arrive at
it, you have to go “through” them all. <span
lang="pi"><em>Upekkhā</em></span> is founded upon <span
lang="pi"><em>mettā</em></span>. It’s the same in terms of <span
lang="pi"><em>jhana</em></span>; if you keep following the principle of
the first <span lang="pi"><em>jhana</em></span>, you will arrive at the
fourth.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Regarding <span lang="pi"><em>mettā</em></span>
specifically, it refers to an attitude of non-aversion rather than
engaging in friendly social interactions or cultivating forms of
love.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Correct. The framework of <span
lang="pi"><em>Brahmavihāra</em></span> centres on cultivating a mind of
non-aversion. This means that even when encountering unpleasant sights,
sounds, smells, tastes, or touches, one does not have ill will towards
them. The focus is on prioritising the protection of the mind of
non-aversion, regardless of the content of one’s everyday
experience.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>This differs from popular ideas of <span
lang="pi"><em>mettā</em></span> practice, which usually consist of
generating love and sending it in various directions.</p>
<p><strong>Nm: </strong>The problem with this is that such a practice
will not uproot craving, which is why that is not what is meant by the
description of <span lang="pi"><em>mettā</em></span> in the suttas.
People prefer that method because it is more palpable, and ‘nicer,’ and
it’s certainly a helpful way of relating to people. In any case, it is
better to think of people with loving kindness rather than hatred,
because if you are not hating them, then more often than not they will
not hate you back; which will help you out at that societal level. So I
am not saying that you shouldn’t do it—by all means think positively
about everyone, but don’t mistake that for practising the Dhamma.</p>
<p>It is dangerous to rely on personal feelings as the basis for one’s
practice: simply because something makes you feel good, does not
necessarily mean that it is the practice of Dhamma. Our emotions are
shaped by our <em>resistance to</em> or <em>indulgence in</em> certain
behaviours or experiences, and therefore, they cannot be relied upon to
determine what is wholesome or unwholesome. So it is crucial to conduct
a comprehensive inquiry into the Buddha’s concept of
[<em>mettā</em>]]{lang=pi}, understand its deeper meaning and practise
it with wisdom and discernment, rather than relying on subjective
feelings.</p>
<p>The term <span lang="pi"><em>mettā</em></span> refers to the general
framework or <em>mind of non-aversion</em>. It is important to emphasise
this because one may not harbour aversion towards someone in particular,
but still hold hatred towards another, indicating the lack of <span
lang="pi"><em>mettā</em></span> in one’s general mindset. Even if one
does not hate anyone specifically, the absence of that particular
aversion alone does not signify the development of <span
lang="pi"><em>mettā</em></span>. To truly cultivate this mindset, one
must make a conscious effort to abandon all <em>possibility</em> of
aversion in all directions and protect and maintain that, regardless of
the circumstances or the people they encounter. Thus, it’s about
removing the possibility of aversion, not the possibility of meeting
disagreeable and unpleasant people and experiences.</p>
<p>The choice to prioritise immediate circumstances over the mind of
non-aversion is a choice to abandon the framework necessary for the
development of <span lang="pi"><em>mettā</em></span>. By protecting and
cherishing the general mindset like a mother would protect her child, as
stated in the <cite>Mettā sutta</cite>, one will prevent actions that
stem from a mind of aversion, and thus protect all living beings as
well.</p>
<p>Also, it is essential to note that the development of <span
lang="pi"><em>mettā</em></span> does not result in having <em>love</em>
for all: it leads to the development of <span
lang="pi"><em>upekkhā</em></span>, or equanimity, which is the ability
to maintain an unshakable mind toward all things without
attachments.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Love breeds infatuation, not equanimity.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes, and it also makes you susceptible to
aversion, fear, and anxiety, because now you depend on it emotionally
and existentially.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> So if you can’t see the direct connection between
<span lang="pi"><em>mettā</em></span> and <span
lang="pi"><em>upekkhā</em></span>, your definition of <span
lang="pi"><em>mettā</em></span> needs redefining. And in terms of <span
lang="pi"><em>karunā</em></span>, how can we get to that stage?</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> You just have to take the same principle of
<span lang="pi"><em>mettā</em></span> a step further. Initially, when
encountering something disagreeable, one may feel aversion towards it.
Then, one can develop a mind of non-aversion towards the unpleasant, but
there may still be some resistance. By further developing the mind of
non-aversion, one begins to refine the <em>principle of
non-resistance</em> that underlies all four <span
lang="pi"><em>Brahmavihāra</em></span>. That non-resistance is the
abandoning of craving, cruelty, and any conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Regarding whatever is felt, pleasant or
unpleasant: if it’s unpleasant, you should practise non-resistance. And
if it’s pleasant, you must not be trying to possess it?</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> People are inclined to pursue pleasant things
because there is a simultaneous resistance to the pain of desire. The
urge for pleasure stems from an aversion to one’s current state. One
resists even pleasure and desires to change it when it isn’t sufficient
(and it never is for one who craves it). Therefore, by cultivating <span
lang="pi"><em>Brahmavihāra</em></span>, one can overcome sensuality too,
which involves resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Maintaining a peaceful mind towards all
<em>feelings</em> is the core practice.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> With the <span
lang="pi"><em>Brahmavihāra</em></span> practice, you cannot hurt
anyone…</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> …because the intention to hurt, to engage in
sensuality, or to be cruel, is always rooted in resisting whatever you
are feeling at the time. Unwholesome actions require <em>resistance to
feeling</em> as their necessary condition.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Moreover, when individuals have established and
stabilised their mind in <span lang="pi"><em>mettā</em></span> and <span
lang="pi"><em>karunā</em></span>, a sense of contentment arises within
them, irrespective of the feeling experienced. This contentment is known
as <span lang="pi"><em>muditā</em></span>.</p>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<p>Then, a <span lang="pi">Bhikkhu</span> might say thus: ’I have
developed and cultivated the liberation of the mind by <span
lang="pi"><em>muditā</em></span>, made it my vehicle and basis, carried
it out, consolidated it, and properly undertaken it, yet discontent
still obsesses my mind.’He should be told: ’Not so! Do not speak thus.
Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; for it is not good to misrepresent
the Blessed One. The Blessed One would certainly not speak in such a
way. It is impossible and inconceivable, friend, that one might develop
and cultivate the liberation of the mind by <span
lang="pi"><em>muditā</em></span>, make it one’s vehicle and basis, carry
it out, consolidate it, and properly undertake it, yet discontent could
still obsess one’s mind. There is no such possibility. For this, friend
is the escape from discontent, namely, the liberation of the mind by
<span lang="pi"><em>muditā</em></span>.</p>
<p>— <cite>AN 6.13</cite></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm</strong>: ‘Altruistic joy,’ which is the usual translation
of <span lang="pi"><em>muditā</em></span>, is not accurate. <span
lang="pi"><em>Muditā</em></span> stems from the principle we’re
discussing here of non-resistance and non-contention towards others and
whatever circumstances arise; safeguarding your mind of benevolence,
which harms no other being. The result is that the mind becomes
imperturbable to any circumstance (or maybe ‘conflict’?).</p>
<p>So as a sense of joy, it’s similar to the joy you get in <span
lang="pi"><em>jhana</em></span>—joy that you’re secluded and unaffected,
free of concern regarding the entire world. You can see how equanimity
regarding good or bad is developed from that.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Another description of <span
lang="pi"><em>muditā</em></span> can be found in <cite>AN
3.95</cite>:</p>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<p>And what is the harmonious assembly? Here, the assembly in which the
bhikkhus dwell in concord, harmoniously, without disputes, blending like
milk and water, viewing each other with eyes of affection, is called the
harmonious assembly.</p>
<p>“When the bhikkhus dwell in concord, harmoniously, without disputes,
blending like milk and water, viewing each other with eyes of affection,
on that occasion, they generate much merit. On that occasion, the
bhikkhus dwell in a divine abode, that is, in the liberation of the mind
through muditā. When one is content, <em>pīti</em> (happiness) arises.
For one with a happy mind, the body becomes calm. One calm in the body
feels pleasure. For one feeling such pleasure, the mind becomes
composed.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> The best way to cultivate a friendly attitude
towards all is to focus on maintaining your mind of friendliness and
non-resistance towards how you feel, and then protect it as a mother
protects her child. When you don’t mind experiencing disagreeable
feelings, it becomes inconceivable to hate the person who seemingly
caused those feelings. You don’t need to manage all your various
individual relationships or circumstances if the <span
lang="pi"><em>Brahmavihāra</em></span> framework is developed—quite the
contrary.</p>
<p>You find that mental “gateway”, through which other beings or
circumstances have to arise and instead of chasing, managing, dealing
with, or trying to prevent those circumstances, you realise, “All I need
to do is protect the gateway and not lose sight of it”. And you protect
it by not acting out of it.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Which results in peacefulness?</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> Peacefulness will come as a result of it, as a
culmination of the absence of your resistance towards what you feel.
Peace is not about <em>not</em> feeling pain. Peace is about not being
disturbed by pain or being pulled by pleasures.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Non-conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Nm: </strong>Yes, non-conflict internally. Can you have a
conflict with anybody externally without already being conflicted with
what you’re feeling internally? Impossible.</p>
<p>Trying to eliminate conflict from the external world is futile
because the source of conflict is internal. It is by resolving your
internal conflict that it becomes impossible for external events to
disturb you, even if the whole world is conflicting with you.</p>
<p><strong><cite>Sutta Nipāta 1.8 Metta Sutta</cite>:</strong></p>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">This is to be done by one skilled in his
