Stilling of *sankhāras* equates to samadhi, so practically, how would
you then convey what *sankhāras* are? It\'s an important term, so how
can you make it not so abstract? Most translations we find are not very
practical, for example, when it\'s translated as 'determinations', you
might ask yourself: "How do I calm determinations? Do I just refrain
from determining anything? How am I even determining things, etc." There
are some even more ambiguous translations such as 'mental formations' or
'energies', etc. But if we look at what is common to
body-*kāya-sankhāras*, speech-*vacī-sankhāras* or mind-citta- or
mano-sankhāras, what we find is that those things are movements,
intentions, directions, pressures, forms of 'activities/activations' in
the broadest sense of the term.

So how to be free from *sankhāras*? How to still all activities? It\'s
not just about not doing anything to be free from *sankhāras* because
abstaining from doing is your doing, that is also an activity. It\'s
about seeing the relationship between wholesome activities and not going
into unwholesome activities, and then fundamentally removing a
particular aspect from activities - the activity of ownership, which is
the root of all problems, and that\'s exactly what the gradual training
is all about. The first few steps- (1) keeping the precepts and (2)
guarding the senses doors, are for the reducing of unwholesome
activities; (3) Moderate in eating and (4) watchfulness - the activities
that you do carefully; (5) Seclusion - not distracting yourself with
work, talk, or company, i.e. moderating activities that you don\'t have
to do unless they are necessary. You are still active in seclusion, you
move around, you intend, clean, plan, etc, but now the background of
those activities can become more obvious, more discernible because you
are not distracted by coarser activities and that\'s exactly how you can
begin to discern and still the fundamental activity based on ignorance,
that of taking things as mine, taking things as belonging to me. The
Buddha called it "*ahaṅkāra and mamaṅkāra*"- I making and mine making.

'Mine-making' is not 'I chose to make this mine', it\'s on the level of
being conscious towards things as if they are yours, including your
'self', so it is of course a subtle *sankhāra*, but if you have been
practising the gradual training, it will be the most obvious thing. You
take things as 'mine', that\'s why 'you' are, it\'s not the other way
round. The activities, paired with ignorance, are there and that\'s why
you have a sense of self which you take as your own. Usually one thinks:
'I am first', 'I am active', 'I am inactive', "I am" equals things that
are mine or not- mine. However, 'Things are assumed to be yours first'
and that\'s already an activity, an assumption which assumes 'I am'.
Activities are already there and you are already taking them implicitly
as 'towards you', 'for you', and that\'s why you have a sense of self.
That sense of self, which is real as such, is dependent on that
assumption of "for me" or \" this is mine\", thus it is not-MY-self.

The removal of that assumption of ownership in regard to the activities,
that you can only discern on account of withdrawing yourself from every
single unwholesome activity of body, speech and mind, i.e. the gradual
training, is peaceful, is sublime, is the stilling of all activities,
the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving,
dispassion, cessation, *nibbāna*. When there is no *avijja* in regard to
*sankhāras*, then sankhāras cease and the activities that are left are
the activities on account of this conscious body and all external
significances/things.
