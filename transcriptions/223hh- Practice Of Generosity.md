223hh- Practice Of Generosity
-----------------------------

**Q:** Is generosity beneficial?

**Nyanamoli:** The act of generosity is an act of giving things up. It
makes you and others feel good. It makes you give things up and feel
good on account of it. Giving up something of yours, part of your
wealth, earnings, possessions, you end up enjoying the fact that
somebody is happy on account of it. It's a less constricted state of
mind. There can be many layers of giving. Some people give by expecting
something back, but it doesn't matter. In itself, the phenomenon of
giving, still requires giving up, and that thread remains wholesome
throughout the giving, even if I give it with the desire for some future
benefit, it's still good to give. Sure, the best way to give is when you
are completely unattached to what you are giving. ([AN
7.49](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN7_49.html))

**Q:** I think generosity also provides the donor a sense of security.

**Nm:** It does and it is an uplifting act. It's a greater state of mind
than the mind of one who doesn't give. The mind that doesn't give always
revolves around habits of taking, possessing, owning, protecting,
worrying, trying to control things that are unownable, things which
cannot be protected, and can be taken away. The only way to sustain that
state is to keep doubling down, constricting the mind more and more and
more, which leads to a bad destination.

Giving prevents that from happening. Giving is like a pressure release
valve to that constriction, it will help your mind to open up. The act
of giving requires you to let go. When you give something up you receive
a greater elevation of mind, because you force your mind to back off,
step away from anything that you have been constricting yourself over.

The true purpose of generosity is to force your mind to expand. That's
why generosity, friendliness, all that goes hand in hand. It's a less
limiting, narrow state of mind.

**Q:** Why would a person be stingy?

**Nm:** Insecurity, fear of non-control. By "holding on" they get a
false sense of security, but it doesn't last long because what they are
holding on to is not secure. Their stinginess is the proliferation of
the sense of self that is being threatened by even little things that it
can't have. The more it proliferates, the more it will need for its
maintenance, and the more sensitive it will become. That's why you have
people who have many things and still it's never enough because they
have become psychologically locked into that pattern of always seeing
that it's never enough because deep down they know that their
attachments cannot be owned to begin with. You can have great amounts of
wealth and so on, but fundamentally, you will feel that it's not in your
control. Deep down, you know that. Why? Because you could die at any
given moment, the economy could crash, thieves could take it away and so
on. All of that is implicit in your 'ownership'. If you don't own it,
how can you be affected if it changes or goes away? That's exactly the
whole point of the encouragement that the Buddha gave to some monks in a
forest:

> "Bhikkhus, whatever is not yours, abandon it. When you have abandoned
> it, that will lead to your welfare and happiness. And what is it,
> bhikkhus, that is not yours? Form is not yours: abandon it. When you
> have abandoned it, that will lead to your welfare and happiness.
> Feeling is not yours ... Perception is not yours ... Intentions are
> not yours ... Consciousness is not yours: abandon it. When you have
> abandoned it, that will lead to your welfare and happiness.
>
> "Suppose people were to carry off the grass, sticks, branches, and
> foliage in this Jeta's Grove, or to burn them, or to do with them as
> they wish. Would you think: 'People are carrying us off, or burning
> us, or doing with us as they wish'?" "No, venerable sir. For what
> reason? Because, venerable sir, that is neither our self nor what
> belongs to our self."
>
> "So too, bhikkhus, form is not yours ... consciousness is not yours:
> abandon it. When you have abandoned it, that will lead to your welfare
> and happiness."

> -- [SN 22.33](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.33)

People who are stingy or miserly, lack wisdom in that regard, they don't
see that they cannot fundamentally own anything, they ignore that fact.
And as a result, they keep doubling down on the action of more ownership
and more control.

**Q:**

> 1- "It is possible, Sīha. One who is generous, a master of giving, is

>
> 5 - "And further, at the break-up of the body, after death, one who is

>
> When this was said, General Sīha said to the Blessed One: "As for the
> four fruits of giving visible in the here & now that have been pointed

> the Blessed One with regard to them. I know them, too. I am generous,
> a master of giving, dear & charming to people at large. I am generous,
> a master of giving; good people, people of integrity, admire me. I am
> generous, a master of giving, and my fine reputation is spread far &
> wide: 'Sīha is generous, a doer, a supporter of the Saṅgha.' I am
> generous, a master of giving, and when I approach any assembly of
> people---noble warriors, brahmans, householders, or contemplatives---I
> do so confidently & without embarrassment.
>
> "But when the Blessed One says to me, 'At the break-up of the body,
> after death, one who is generous, a master of giving, reappears in a
> good destination, a heavenly world,' that I do not know. That is where
> I go by conviction in the Blessed One."
>
> "So it is, Sīha. So it is. At the break-up of the body, after death,
> one who is generous, a master of giving, reappears in a good
> destination, a heavenly world."
>
> One who gives is dear. People at large admire him. He gains honor. His
> status grows. He enters an assembly unembarrassed. He is a confident,
> non-stingy man.
>
> Therefore the wise give gifts. Seeking happiness they would subdue the
> stain of miserliness. Established in the three-fold heavenly world,
> they enjoy themselves long in fellowship with the devas. Having made
> the opportunity for themselves, having done what is skillful, then
> when they fall from here they fare on, self-radiant, in Nandana \[the
> garden of the devas\]. There they delight, enjoy, are joyful, replete
> with the five sensuality strands. Having followed the words of the
> sage who is Such, they enjoy themselves in heaven, the disciples of
> the One Well-Gone."

> -- [AN 5.34](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN5_34.html)

**Nm:** Why would you become confident? Why would you not be as
confident if you're not generous? Why would generosity make you more
confident in any assembly?

Because it's a less limiting state of mind. Lack of confidence is an
extremely constricted state of mind, whereby you are afraid and insecure
in regard to many things most of the time. However, through generosity,
you're forcing your mind to expand, and when the state of mind is more
expansive, it is less constricted, less afraid, less able to twitch to
the left or to the right on the basis of some random perception. An
expansive mind can take more. The more limitless the mind, the more
confident you will be, not conceited, but confident, and simply less
moved, because the mind is broader.

**Q:** In that sense, the expanded mind of generosity is the cure for
social anxiety.

**Nm:** Exactly, social anxiety because of which I don't engage with
others because of which my anxiety increases because of which I don't
engage with others. It's a vicious circle. Well, generosity is a nice
way to engage with others, and in that way you start breaking the
vicious circle of anxiously non-engaging with others. And even a little
act of generosity is enough to set your mind at least to some extent, in
that direction of expansion. By being generous, you force your mind to
broaden.

Through generosity you get to override those thoughts of fear. You get
to elevate your mind above those thoughts even if those thoughts are
present. And then it doesn't matter if people laugh at you and so on.
What actually matters is that you actually did the generous deed. That's
why generosity is a practice. It's not like you do a generous act and
suddenly have this religious experience and everyone likes you. Of
course, somebody who has been very miserly, it might feel like
that,i.e. any little expansion from an extremely constricted mind will
feel like a religious experience.

Generosity is a practice. If you do it, if you develop it alongside
wisdom,i.e. you don't just start giving everything carelessly away, when
your own family's starving or go and give all your money to a casino.
But rather, when you can give, if you earn more than you need, you can
always dedicate part of those earnings towards giving, and you don't
have to overthink it, you don't make demands, just find what it's good
to give, who can be helped, and do it, and then practice doing it. In
that way, you will start building up that behaviour of generosity, that
will then become a quality which decorates your mind, and not just when
you are giving, even generally, you will know yourself as a generous
person, that knowledge, that decoration will be there in the background.
That's exactly one of the benefits. That knowledge will be in others as
well. It's not like you have to have an audience when you're giving all
the time. But if you are practising giving sufficiently enough, it will
be known. But you wouldn't care whether it's known to others or not, but
it will be known by you. That's a fact. That's why Buddha listed it as
one of the inevitable benefits.

> "...Then there is the case where you recollect your own generosity:
> 'It is a gain, a great gain for me, that among people overcome with
> the stain of possessiveness, I live at home, my awareness cleansed of
> the stain of possessiveness, freely generous, open handed, delighting
> in being magnanimous, responsive to requests, delighting in the
> distribution of alms.' At any time when a disciple of the noble ones
> is recollecting generosity, his mind is not overcome with passion, not
> overcome with aversion, not overcome with delusion. His mind heads
> straight, based on generosity. And when the mind is headed straight,
> the disciple of the noble ones gains a sense of the goal, gains a
> sense of the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. In one who
> is joyful, happiness arises. In one whose mind is happy, the body
> grows calm. One whose body is calmed experiences ease. In one at ease,
> the mind becomes composed..."

> -- [AN 11.12](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN11_12.html)

It's a practice that should be developed and encouraged for individual
benefit of your own mind expansion and benefit of others. You can also
encourage others to be generous by setting a good example, which will
then in return, help their own minds from escaping the state of insecure
constricted stinginess.

> "...This world is on fire with aging, illness, & death. With the world
> thus on fire with aging, illness, & death, any restraint of body,
> speech, and mind practiced here will be one's shelter, cave, island, &
> refuge after death in the world beyond." When a house is aflame, the
> vessel salvaged is the one that will be of use, not the one left there
> to burn. So when the world is on fire with aging & death, you should
> salvage (your wealth) by giving: What's given is well salvaged. When
> you're restrained herein body, speech and mind; when you make merit
> while still alive: That will be for your happiness after death."
