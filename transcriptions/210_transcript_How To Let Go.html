will be for your long-term happiness &amp; benefit. And what is not
yours?</p>
<p>“The eye isn’t yours: Let go of it. Your letting go of it will be for
your long-term happiness &amp; benefit. Forms are not yours…
Eye-consciousness isn’t yours… Eye-contact isn’t yours… Whatever arises
in dependence on eye-contact—experienced either as pleasure, as pain, or
as neither-pleasure-nor-pain—that too isn’t yours: Let go of it. Your
letting go of it will be for your long-term happiness &amp; benefit.</p>
<p>“The ear isn’t yours: Let go of it…</p>
<p>“The nose isn’t yours: Let go of it…</p>
<p>“The tongue isn’t yours: Let go of it…</p>
<p>“The body’s not yours: Let go of it…</p>
<p>“The intellect’s not yours: Let go of it. Your letting go of it will
be for your long-term happiness &amp; benefit. Ideas are not yours…
Intellect-consciousness isn’t yours… Intellect-contact isn’t yours…</p>
<p>Whatever arises in dependence on intellect-contact—experienced either

<p>“Suppose a person were to gather or burn or do as he likes with the
grass, twigs, branches, &amp; leaves here in Jeta’s Grove. Would the
thought occur to you, ‘It’s us that this person is gathering, burning,
or doing with as he likes’?”</p>
<p>“No, lord. Why is that? Because those things are not our self nor do
they pertain to our self.”</p>
<p>“In the same way, monks, the eye isn’t yours: Let go of it. Your
letting go of it will be for your long-term happiness &amp; benefit… The
ear… The nose… The tongue… The body… The intellect’s not yours: Let go
of it. Your letting go of it will be for your long-term happiness &amp;

<p>When you ask “How do I let go?”, do you ask that question when you
are at the peak of happiness and when life is comfortable? Do you ask
how to let go of that pleasure or excitement? No. That question is
always asked when there’s something bothering you, when you’re
overwhelmed, when something that you do not want is not going away, when
you can’t help but keep revolving around something that’s unpleasant.
That’s when you want to know how to let go.</p>
<p>However, you have to stop trying to get rid of that suffering because
<em>letting go</em> entails developing wisdom in regard to the nature of
not being able to hold things in the first place. If you were truly
<em>holding</em> the loved one, they would not have passed, they would
not have changed, you would not have been experiencing suffering, you
would have been in control.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Bhikkhus, form is non-self. For if, bhikkhus, form were self, this
form would not lead to affliction, and it would be possible to control
form: ‘Let my form be thus; let my form not be thus.’</p>
<p>But because form is non-self, form leads to affliction, and it is not
possible to control form: ‘Let my form be thus; let my form not be
thus.’</p>
<p>“Feeling is non-self…. … Perception is non-self…. Intentions are
non-self…. Consciousness is non-self. For if, bhikkhus, consciousness
were self, this consciousness would not lead to affliction, and it would
be possible to control consciousness: ‘Let my consciousness be thus; let
my consciousness not be thus.’ But because consciousness is non-self,
consciousness leads to affliction, and it is not possible to control
consciousness: ’Let my consciousness be thus; let my consciousness not
be thus.”</p>

<p>When things are comfortable, people don’t want to look at the nature
of change or contemplate letting go.</p>
<p>When things are happy and bright. They fully develop a belief that
they are in control of what they own, what they possess, who they love,
who they are. But then when things change, as you know they will but you
have been ignoring that fact, NOW you want to let go. But really now you
just want to not suffer the painful consequences which are the result of
you holding on.</p>
<p>It’s also not a question of never engaging with the world because
things will change. It’s about never losing perspective, in regard to
that which is subject to change, which is everything around you,
including yourself.</p>
<p>In other words, letting go is not something you do. Letting go is
understanding that you could not have held things in the first
place.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“…Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu is practising in this way—‘It could not be
and it could not be mine; it will not be, it will not be mine. Whatever
there is, whatever exists—I abandon that’. In this way he obtains
equanimity. He does not delight in that equanimity, he doesn’t welcome
it, doesn’t keep holding on to it. For him, not delighting in that
equanimity, not welcoming it, not holding onto it, consciousness is not
dependent on it, he doesn’t assume it. Ānanda, a bhikkhu who is without
assumptions, is fully extinguished.”</p>

<p>Don’t just reflect on letting go when there is discomfort or when
there is pain, or when there is reminder of it, but do it at the peak of
your happiness. When everything is ne, everything is going your way, be
aware that it could have not been that way and it won’t be that way.
That reflection and remembrance can result in a slight uneasiness, but
that is the gateway to that right perspective of recognising the true
meaning of <em>anicca</em> that the Buddha spoke about. <em>Anicca</em>
means “subject to change”, it doesn’t mean “changing al the time”, it
means “subject to change, against your will , outside of your scope of
your control, you are subject to it”.</p>
<p>Understanding <em>anicca</em>, understanding “being subject to
change” means letting go, it means preventing yourself from assuming
that you are holding on.</p>
<p>Often you will get given advice to just let go, but “just let go” is
not a matter of choice. Even <em>holding</em> is not a matter of choice.
It’s the result of whether you have perspective in regard to what is
subject to change or if you’re ignoring that. If you’re ignoring the
nature that things are subject to change, that things are fundamentally
not in your control, then you’re “holding”, even if you don’t think “I
will hold this dearly”, you are already making something dear to you and
you’re holding it blindly. If you’re not ignoring that things are
subject to change, if you’re consciously making an effort “Oh look, this
is my dog, my pet I had it my whole life, his life can end, my life can
end, that’s the most natural thing. But I don’t want to think about it
only when it happens, and now pretend that it will never happen, and
just laugh it o and change the subject. Such an attitude means I am
ignoring the basic, crude, obvious reality of things being subjected to
change, that is against my will , and because of that I’m holding on to
things, not because I look after the dog.</p>
<p>Just because I feed it doesn’t mean I’m attached. No. Only if I DO
NOT have perspective in regard to the dog being subject to change, or
myself being subject to change, then that’s how I’m holding, that’s how
I’m attached”. Likewise with family, possessions, wealth, health, things
you take for granted. You take them for granted by ignoring that they
are subject to change, because it’s disconcerting to think about it. You
think you can avoid it by ignoring it, but then you pay the price when
they change and you’re affected, and then you want to let go. But that’s
just the result of everything else you’ve been holding wrongly
before.</p>
<p>“How do I let go?”, should be reformulated as “How do I not lose
perspective in regard to that which I hold dearly and is subject to
change?</p>
<p>Well, by making an effort to think about these things, rightly, even
if you have to set some time aside everyday, like half an hour and just
contemplate how things are subject to change. When you are doing such a
contemplation, if you feel anxious, al ow that feeling to manifest,
because that is the feeling of the world that you’re in. That anxiety is
the result of recognising the true nature of things, and initially,
that’s not going to be pleasant to the mind which up to that point, has
been making all the effort to ignore the nature of change. If somebody
is asking the question, “How to let go?” That means at least to that
extent, they have some sort of recognition of their responsibility in
their own suffering.</p>
<p>The suffering you’re experiencing on account of not letting go is the
result of an underlying problem of ignoring that things are subject to
change. You don’t admit that to yourself enough, you never let that sink
in deep enough, because it’s felt unpleasantly. As simple as that.
Therefore, you can start letting go by admitting these things to
yourself, by contemplating it, and by enduring the unpleasantness of it
when it arises. You can realise that you have a choice, you’re either
going to endure those mild anxieties and concerns on account of the
realisation that, “Yes, things will change and I will not ignore this”.
Or you’re going to pretend it’s not there, and then be completely
crushed, when things do change against your will . That’s when you will
be asking, “How do I let go?”. You might even lose your mind with grief
and so on. So don’t wait for that to prompt you to think about letting
go. Don’t wait until it’s too late.</p>
<p>You can let go or become detached by seeing that you could not have
been attached to it in the first place, and the only way to see that is
to contemplate that. It will prevent you from being attached the way you
are.</p>
<p>You cannot be attached to your pets or a loved one or possessions, if
you don’t forget they can be taken away at any given second, and the
fact that that is a possibility, means they were never yours to begin
with, no matter how long you have been attached to them, no matter how
deeply you have loved them. It doesn’t matter what you do, this is the
ultimate context, “THIS is subject to change, it’s against my will”,
that’s <em>anicca</em>. Mindfulness of that context is worth developing
because it leads to true freedom.</p>
<p>If you do make the effort and sustain the perspective that, “My dear
pet can be taken away at any given time”. That perspective will prevent
you from becoming blindly, carelessly, obliviously attached to it. And
when things change, there will not be as much of a shock to the system,
because you know beforehand that it is truly out of your hands. So the
grief will be seriously dampened, and if you’ve truly developed a full
understanding of <em>anicca</em>, there will be no grief at all. Even
for people who are not monks or who are not committed to this practice
24/7, it’s still a useful thing to be aware of, the fact that things are
subject to change. It’s quite a useful superpower that you can develop
in this life. It keeps you more resilient, more patient, more stable,
more impermeable to disruptions, because sometimes things might change
quickly into one thing and then into another, from very pleasant, to
intensely unpleasant, and you will still be able to sustain some sort of
composure in regard to it, which most people would not. Which means your
well being, your contentment will be less affected, even as an undevoted
practitioner.</p>
<p>It’s always useful to have that authentic recognition of “things are
subject to change”. But it needs to be done on that personal level.
Usually when a person hears about <em>anicca</em>, it’s often taken in
this abstract sense,</p>
<p>“Yes, everything is subject to change. Modern science has shown
everything is constantly changing, etc”.</p>
<p>People tend to think about <em>anicca</em> in those completely
impersonal terms, but that’s not <em>anicca</em>. <em>Anicca</em> is
finding that which is dear to you, and contemplating that to be subject
to change, and then see how indifferent you’re going to stay if you
start thinking like that. If you work through that unease on account of
contemplating the loss of that which is personally dear to you, that’s
where freedom from suffering canbe found. The letting go that comes from
understanding the nature of things is how you will not suffer even when
your dearest family members, pets, friends, or whatever, change, die or
leave. Your mind will not be affected. That doesn’t mean that you will
not perceive what has happened or not know the significance of an event,
it just means you will not be as affected by it because you never lost
perspective in regards to that which is inevitable- sickness, old age
and death.</p>

<p>“What do you think, bhikkhus: is matter permanent or
impermanent?”</p>
<p>“Impermanent, Bhante”.</p>
<p>“And whatever is impermanent: is that suffering or pleasure?”</p>
<p>“Suffering, Bhante”.</p>
<p>“And whatever is impermanence, suffering, of the nature to change: is
it appropriate to see that as</p>
<p>‘This is mine, I am this, this is myself’?”</p>
<p>“No,Bhante”.</p>
<p>“Is feeling. .perception. .determinations. .consciousness permanent

<p>“No, Bhante”.</p>
<p>“Therefore, bhikkhus, whatever matter—past-future-present, here or
external, coarse or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near—the
essence of all matter should be seen with the right understanding in

<p>Seeing in this way, bhikkhus, a noble disciple becomes disenchanted
with matter, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception,
disenchanted with determinations, disenchanted with consciousness.
Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Dispassionate, he is liberated.
Liberated, there is the knowledge: ‘Liberated’. He understands: ‘Birth
is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what should be done has been
done, there is no more of this.’”</p>
