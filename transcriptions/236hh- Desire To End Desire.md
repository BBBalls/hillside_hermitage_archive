**Q:** What is the difference between desire- *chanda* and craving-
*tanha*?

**Nyanamoli:** The difference is that *chanda*-desire is a form of zeal,
interest, and it can be either wholesome or unwholesome. If you have a
desire towards sensuality, that is *kamachanda*-sensual desire, which is
not a wholesome desire. So then if you want to be free from sensuality
because you started to understand the dissatisfaction of it, then you
can have a desire to be free from it, to be free from sensuality and
sensual desire. It\'s still a form of desire that can make you want to
practice the Dhamma. It\'s a desire that can eventual y result in
freedom from sensual desire. *Chanda* is not in itself bad, nor good, it
just depends on where you direct it. It\'s not a question of not having
desires as you begin to practice. It\'s really about having the desires
that are directed at the development of the wholesome and the
diminishing of the unwholesome.

When you are free from any desire towards sensuality and so on, you will
also lose the desire towards the wholesome because that is now what you
are. At that point, you don\'t need to have a desire to develop the
wholesome once that wholesome is developed. That\'s how desire, directed
rightly, can result in freedom from desire all together, freedom from
*chanda* all together.

Abandoning unskilful desire is not a matter of choice, it\'s a matter of
directing it towards a certain kind of behaviour, that kind being the
[*gradual training*,](https://suttacentral.net/mn125) which will then
remove any basis for perpetuation of unskilful desire later on.

In other words, when you become aware of your illness, you need to have
a desire to be cured. That desire will make you look for a doctor, find
the right medicine, and then sustain the application of the medicine on
the basis of desire for health. And then once you\'re cured, and healed,
and there is absolutely not even the slightest trace of your illness
left, you will have no more desire to be cured because you\'re cured.
However, if while you\'re ill and you think, "Okay, so being free from
illness means having no desire to be cured, thus, I will have no desire
to be cured", that way of thinking will prevent you from curing
yourself.

In the beginning, a person cannot distinguish between bad or good
desire. That\'s why you need to start with sense restraint, as we always
say. But you don\'t want to be trying to not have desires. You want to
be trying to see where your desires are directed. And if it\'s a desire
for physical pleasures, of the lustful kind. That\'s a desire you should
not cultivate, that\'s the desire you should abandon, not welcome, not
entertain, endure until it passes without acting out of it.

An *anagami,* who is free from sensual desire, is not free from
*chanda*. He\'s free from desire towards the sense objects of pleasures.
In other words, freedom from sensuality doesn\'t mean absence of
*chanda* of any kind, it means loss of interest and zeal for the sensual
type of pleasure. Why? Because the gratification has been fully
understood, the danger has been fully understood and the escape has been
fully understood.

> \"That any brahmins or contemplatives who do not discern, as it
> actually is, the gratification of sensuality as gratification, the
> drawback of sensuality as drawback, the escape from sensuality as
> escape, would themselves understand sensuality or would rouse another
> with the truth so that, in line with what he has practiced, he would
> understand sensuality: That is impossible. But that any brahmins or

> sensuality as gratification, the drawback of sensuality as drawback,
> the escape from sensuality as escape, would themselves understand
> sensuality or would rouse another with the truth so that, in line with
> what he has practiced, he would understand sensuality: That is
> possible.\"

It\'s not that an *anagami* or an *arahant* have no concept anymore of
what physical pleasure would feel like, it\'s that they have no interest
in it anymore on the level of the mind, intent or thought. They\'re
absolutely free from any zeal that a person not free from sensuality
would otherwise have. An untrained person who has a sensual thought, is
immediately pressured to act out of that thought and pursue sensual
pleasures, because there exists an inclination towards it, there is a
welcoming of that prospect of pleasure, the possibility of
gratification.

That inclination can only be abandoned through seeing the danger of that
delighting towards sense objects.

You will not have an interest in ingesting poison if you understood the
deadliness of the poison. Even though the texture and taste of it
hasn\'t changed, the pleasure hasn\'t changed, but your understanding
now of seeing it as a poison, that has changed, and so you have
absolutely no zeal towards that kind of pleasure whatsoever. You have no
interest in it.

**Q:** A person might say, "Well, I understand that sensuality is bad.
Yet, I\'m still attracted."

**Nm:** For as long as you haven\'t fully understood the gratification,
the danger and the escape, you will still value sensuality, which means
that you should not claim that you understood sensuality. Because if you
do make such a statement, that means you\'re contradicting yourself. If
you fully understood those three aspects, there would be no *chanda*
towards sensuality left, there would only be *chanda* towards
renunciation, towards seclusion, towards further abandonment.

A person might think, "Yes, I understand the peril of sensuality". Okay,
fine. Ask yourself the next question.

"So am I free from any form of delight, welcoming, zeal, interest,
curiosity even towards pleasures that come on account of objects of the
senses that are provocative of lust?". "No, I don\'t think I\'m free of
that. Or I\'m not sure if I\'m free that.", that means you\'re not free
of that, that means that you should not think you understood it, and
that you need to make more of an effort in the direction of
understanding.

Nobody denies that you will have some insight or some degree of insight
into sensuality once you start restraining, but don\'t think that\'s
freedom until you know, "I am free. I don\'t want this, this is truly
something I have no interest in anymore, quite the opposite".

You might spend most of your day not having interest in sensual
pursuits, but are you still liable to having interest in sensual
pursuits? If so, you\'re not outside of the domain of sensual desire.

You always want to look at that level of *liability*, "Am I liable to
become careless and interested in sensual pursuits again? Well ,
maybe?". Well , there you go, you\'re not free from doubt in regard to
it, which means you\'re not free from it.

As for *tanha*, it\'s subtler than *chanda*. *Tanha* is on a different
level. *Chanda* is kind of an active quality that you either carelessly
engage with on account of your past behaviour that hasn\'t been
restrained, or something you can cultivate, as the Buddha would say, \"
he generates desire... for the sake of the non-arising of evil,
unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen...\".

You can reflect on why it\'s good to be cured, why it\'s good to make
the effort towards abandoning the unwholesome and cultivating the
wholesome, why it\'s good to practice the gradual training, why it\'s
good to be virtuous and sense restraint, and because of those
reflections you will be generating a desire to develop those practices.

*Tanha* is more on an immediate level of your attitude towards your
present enduring feeling, whatever it is.

That attitude is always rooted in *resistance*. If there is craving for
pleasure, that is rooted in you resisting the current feeling, which is
not necessarily unpleasant, but it\'s not sufficient, i.e. the pleasure,
it\'s not sufficient, which is why you crave for more pleasure. Which
means, it\'s painful.

Any resistance is painful, and with the mind of resistance, if you
experience pleasure, you will by default be resisting it, because by
default, you want more of it. With the mind not free from *tanha*, when
you experience pain, by default you\'re resisting it, because you don\'t
want any of it. You want it to completely go away. With the mind not
free from *tanha*, when you experience a neutral feeling, you will
automatically resist it, you will incline towards oblivion, towards
ignoring it, towards turning away from it, because you don\'t understand
it. *Tanha,* practical y speaking, is always that resistance on the
level of what you\'re currently feeling.

**Q:** Even if you\'re feeling pleasure, you\'re still resisting it.
It\'s not good enough for you.

**Nm:** Absolutely. That\'s why if you\'re not free from craving, every
pleasure will be underlined by craving for more. With the presence of
resistance, there is the presence of dissatisfaction, presence of
*tanha* means *dukkha* is there, presence of *dukkha* means *tanha* is
there.

If *tanha* is still present, that means that there is still resistance
to whatever feeling is there for you at the time, and that\'s why you
suffer, not because of what is felt but because of that resistance. And
why would you be resisting? Why is it that you\'re not content with an
agreeable feeling that is present? Why is it, that by default, the mind
wants more of it? It\'s because of the wrong view in regard to what
pleasure is, what sensuality is, what gratification is. Sensuality is a
form of *upadana*, an assumption, it\'s a view, it\'s basically the
values that you uphold throughout your day to day existence.

Sensual desire is felt unpleasantly and that\'s why you want to gratify
your senses, because non-gratified senses hurt. However, your resistance
is the suffering there, and so if you stop resisting the non gratified
senses, they\'l stop hurting and there will be no suffering there
despite the senses being gratified.

You don\'t see that the suffering is on the level of your *resistance*.
You think suffering exists because there is no gratification of the
senses, and so you go out and seek gratification, and that\'s why you
keep perpetuating your suffering.

First, you need to stop seeking out the gratification of the senses. So
that your *resistance* to the non-gratified senses becomes apparent as
the cause of your suffering. And then you realise, "Oh, I stop
resisting. It stops hurting". Which means that gratifying the senses
becomes redundant.

The habit of resistance (craving) perpetuates the sensuality view that
non-gratified senses cause suffering and gratified senses means freedom
from suffering.

*Tanha* feeds *kāmupādāna-* the assumption of sense desire, and the
*kāmupādāna* feeds *tanha*, that\'s why it\'s beginningless. It\'s a
vicious circle, it has no beginning. It\'s not that you were pure, then
you develop *tanha*, and then you develop *upadana*. No, you start
already infected, perverted, mistaken, confused, assumed.

Corruption is beginningless. And that\'s why if you understand it, if
you uproot the gratuitous assumption or the craving, both will be
uprooted and cannot revert back. The uprooting is irreversible.
