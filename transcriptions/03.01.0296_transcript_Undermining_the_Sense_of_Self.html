<p><strong>Ajahn Nyanamoli:</strong> What would be the measure of
success in this practice?</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The full development of <em>anatta</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> How does one go about developing that?…</p>
<p>It’s not enough to just say, “Oh, this is not mine, not I am, not
myself.” To do that, first, you need to discern that <em>sense of
self</em> correctly, and then you need to see it as <em>not yours</em>
and not as an independent master existing outside of this situation.</p>
<p>It’s not about finding an answer to the question of “What is myself
and not-self..?”, and so on. It’s about the mental practice of whatever
that <em>sense of self</em> is, in whichever way it endures, to see it
as second, as within, as fully enclosed within this inescapable limits
of this situation as a whole—body posture, feeling, perceptions,
intentions and so on—then sustain that view. You might then ask, “What’s
next?”. But that’s it.</p>
<p>You will of course fall from that view, and you certainly won’t even
do it right the first time. But, if you know that’s what you’re supposed
to do, i.e not try to remove the <em>sense of self</em>, but simply set
up the correct way of attending to it, by way of <em>yoniso</em> of that
attention, (Peripherally knowing it concurrently with that which is
being attended.) then you stand a chance for that view to take root.</p>
<p>You can presently recollect your <em>sense of self</em> now as we
speak. It doesn’t matter whether it’s exemplified through a clear
thought or ambiguous <em>sense of I am sitting here</em>. That <em>I
am</em>, it’s obviously not this physical thing. It’s not about denying
that I am, trying to force it into not-self, or dismissing it as
unimportant. No, you want that <em>sense of self</em> to be known for
what it is, and for that you need it to endure in clear comprehension,
while there is this situation of this body, perception, sounds, mouth,
taste, touches, etc enduring.</p>
<p>If that’s too complex, you could simply see, “Okay, there is this
<em>situation as a whole</em> based on this body to whatever extent it
is, and there is this <em>sense of self enduring</em> there as
well.”</p>
<p>Do you see that? Do you see your <em>sense of self</em> enduring
simultaneously on a different plane from your five senses, your
thoughts, and everything else? Here and yonder, the situation of this
infinite space and my <em>sense of self</em> perpendicular to that,
simultaneously here?</p>
<p>At any given time, it doesn’t matter what you’re engaged with, if
someone were to ask you who you are, you would have that recognition of
<em>your self</em> right there. The point is to not bother trying to
define who you are or who <em>I am</em>. Just discern it enduring there
as this weird-ambiguous-phenomenon that you can never put your finger
on, but it’s always there. The point is to not even bother trying to put
a finger on it but to not lose sight of it as something that is always
there lingering in the background.</p>
<p>As much as your body, your current posture, your feeling, and your
perception are the basis of that inescapability of this situation, here
and yonder, the image of the self—or the notion of the self—is equally
the other end of the inescapability of your situation. You are not
outside of that image either. When you recognize these two things: the
body and situation as a whole are there on their own, you can then
realize, “Oh, this phenomenon is there on its own, as a result of this
here, that is also on its own.”</p>
<p>The <em>sense of self</em> being more ambiguous, more in the
background, less palpable, less measurable, naturally gets bundled with
that aroma of subjectivity, of <em>mine</em>, and <em>I am</em>, because
it feels <em>above</em> or <em>behind</em> all of this. It’s the
observer of all of this. And it doesn’t matter what kind of observer it
is, and how it might feel. The only reason it can be an observer is
because there is this to be observed. If there is nothing to be
observed, the observer would not be—because nothing is defining it.</p>
<p>Recognize that it’s not that the observer comes first and this, the
rest, comes second. No, it’s <em>“with the observer, the observed
is”</em>. With the observed—felt, perceived, tasted, touched—the
observer is. If your mind is calm within that principle, and you have
room to move without falling off from it—from this type of
<em>samadhi</em>—you can then think about various particular aspects of
that relationship. But, fundamentally, the point is simply to get very
used to having the <em>sense of self</em> endure simultaneously with
having this experience endure as it changes, as you speak, move, and
stand up, and so on. Two simultaneous things at the same time - “two
points of view”. If you become familiar with that, because you’ve been
looking for it, then that self-centered—one point of view—at the same
time will be undermined simply through that. (For <em>self</em> to
remain standing, there needs to be one point of view, not two. If there
are two there is not one.)</p>
<p>The Buddha taught the undermining of the sense of self, the
undermining of the one, through seeing the two simultaneously present. A
person has to understand and see that. Not just think, “Oh, that’s a
lovely idea. I have faith in it.” but rather, one has to see it and then
stick to repeatedly seeing it out of faith. And as a result, even
without making effort towards more specific clarifications, you will
arrive at the final goal.</p>
<p>By understanding and holding to that principle, keeping it
clear—<em>with this, this is; without this, this would not be</em>,
anything else that you assume is <em>in between</em>, anything
pertaining to <em>mine</em> or <em>subjectivity</em> will evaporate.</p>
<p>All the other contemplations you find in the Suttas are all for
exercising this same principle to completely remove any trace of
conceit. For example, the recollection of this body that I’m enclosed
with is dependent upon that which it isn’t - namely food. The phenomenon
of food being present is why this body is alive. If you take that away,
the body will not be able to remain.</p>
<p>If you cultivate this right way of viewing, based on the precepts,
sense restraint, and solitude, you will be able to handle it, not be
overwhelmed with anxiety and can take it to its conclusion - complete
<em>Nibbana</em>. If, however, you try to bypass those prerequisites,
the anxiety that will appear due to not seeing any ground for yourself
to stand upon will overwhelm you. But, if you have been cultivating the
Gradual Training beforehand, this view will be liberating. That
undermining the <em>sense of self</em>, in that indirect manner, will
feel like a relief from a burden, from the tension, from the pressure of
existence. The clearer the view becomes—<em>with this, this is</em>—two
simultaneous things. Even if you don’t specifically think about the
ownership and uprooting it, it is being uprooted.</p>
<p>Sometimes people mystify it and say, “Oh, it’s the observer, the pure
consciousness, the knower, the this, the that…” It’s just different
phrasing for the same thing—<em>I am</em>. And that’s not the way out.
Never has been. You want to see that it doesn’t matter how lofty, how
remote, how distant, or how great that observer or the knower might
feel. Would it be there if this situation is not enduring the way it is?
No. Thus <em>‘with this, this is’</em>. That all-knowing seer, the
knower, it’s pretty much to the same extent, not a bit more, not a bit
less, subjected to the same things that all of this is subjected
to—impermanence, suffering, and unownability. It doesn’t matter how it
feels, what matters is that it ceases to be assumed as <em>yours</em>.
Whether that <em>sense of self</em> feels coarse or lofty, refined,
pleasant or unpleasant, it’s just the reflection of the same principle
that’s here, nothing else. That’s the true unburdening because there is
no more of that assumed center that takes all the weight on.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Getting used to this type of contemplation will
lessen its dissonance with one’s sense of security and sense of self.
The first time you realize that something you thought was so solid and
so secure is just a flimsy house of cards, it’s terrifying. But now, if
it’s just a house of cards, it’s just a house of cards, you don’t expect
anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Nm:</strong> If through the Gradual Training, you stop adding
more fuel to the fire of passion, aversion, and ownership, then the more
of the same recognition that <em>this is a flimsy house of cards which
is going to collapse</em>, will be cultivated. The more you have that
established, the less unpleasant it will be. And it was unpleasant, not
because of its recognition, but because of your emotional involvement
with the house of cards, dependence on it, views, refusal to allow it to
be otherwise—out of that gratuitous sense of ownership of the
self-centered experience.</p>
<p>Now if doubt, regarding the principle of that simultaneous view,
arises, you can, if the view has been established, see that doubt as
also second to it. The purpose isn’t to avoid doubts, but rather to
overcome them with the same principle of non-ownership. Doubt cannot
access that which precedes it, which is its necessary basis.</p>

<p>A person thus with such a purified view, thus accomplished, holding
it, cherishing it, taking it as one’s own, would they know that the
Dhamma is like a raft for the sake of crossing over rather than holding
on to?</p>
<p>No</p>
