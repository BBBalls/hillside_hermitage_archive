<p>The fundamental nature of our experience can be described as a
hierarchy, which Ven. Ñāṇavīra tried to explain in his FUNDAMENTAL
STRUCTURE (NoD). We are what we experience, it is not possible to view
(or imagine) this hierarchy from ‘outside’, independent of us, because
regardless of how far one steps back, one cannot abandon the experience
as such.</p>
<p>The experience, whether mundane or sublime, possesses certain
characteristics, and the most prominent among them is that it is
<em>hierarchically ordered</em>. This hierarchy goes into infinity in
both directions, and this is something which can be seen from the nature
of <em>particulars</em> and <em>generals</em>. If we take a look at our
own experience as it is, we can see that there are two aspects which
appear as being more pronounced than anything else. Those aspects are
known as <em>immediacy</em> and <em>reflexion</em>. Together they
comprise this hierarchy of the experience <em>as a whole</em>. Thus, the
hierarchy we have been referring to can be called <em>reflexive
hierarchy</em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> If we want to be more precise we can
say that immediacy and reflexion, respectively, represent two different
modes of experiencing this hierarchy. In immediacy, reflexion is not
directly present; it is there, but placed in the background. In
reflexion, the immediate object is seen from an <em>additional point of
view</em>, which means that once we reflect upon something, immediacy
<em>does not</em> disappear, it rather becomes secondary to the field of
attention but, nevertheless, it remains there:</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“In immediate experience the thing is present; in reflexive
experience the thing is again present, but as implicit in a more general
thing. Thus in reflexion the thing is twice present, once immediately
and once reflexively. This is true of reflexion both in the loose sense
(as reflection or discursive thinking) and <em>a fortiori</em> in the
stricter sense (for the reason that reflection involves reflexion,
though not vice versa). See MANO and also VIÑÑĀṆA.” (NoD, ATTĀ (a))</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The presence of this reflexive hierarchy, as can be seen from
FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURE,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> generates another dimension to the
experience. This dimension is also hierarchically ordered, superimposed
upon the original reflexive one; dependent upon it, but at the same time
responsible for the existence of it. This simply means that their type
of dependence is not temporal, i.e. it does not occur in sequence. This
new hierarchy is the <em>hierarchy of awareness</em>, and although this
hierarchy cannot go ‘below’ the experience as such (awareness is always
awareness of something in-the-world), there is no limit for ascending
levels of this hierarchy. As the term ‘generating’ implies, with the
presence of reflexive hierarchy the hierarchy of awareness is also
present—<em>simultaneously</em>; and as was already said, the existence
of this hierarchy, makes the reflexion possible in the first place.</p>
<p>Let us try and say something more about the nature of
superimposition, which is relevant for these two hierarchies. When
things are <em>superimposed</em> they are not <em>directly</em> or
<em>linearly</em> related. They are simply <em>there</em>, next to each
other and any thought along the lines of <em>causality</em> distorts
them as they are.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This superimposed way of existing is
nothing else than what is meant by being <em>akālika</em>, ‘timeless’ or
‘beyond time’. Two things are there, dependent, yet not directly related
to each other. That is the reason why we said that with the presence of
reflexive hierarchy there is the <em>presence</em> of the hierarchy of
awareness. This precedes any notions of causality or of time.
Nevertheless, if we still insist on describing their mutual
relationship, the most accurate way would be to simply say: with
reflexion, awareness <em>is</em>; without reflexion awareness <em>is
not</em>. This is clearly a reference to <em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em>
itself, so now would be the right time to say something more about
it.</p>
<p><em>Paṭiccasamuppāda</em> is <em>a principle of timeless
dependence</em>, i.e. existential superimposition. With the presence of
one thing the other thing is simultaneously present, too. Thus, it is
not possible to conceive or imagine <em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em> without
actually seeing it within the experience, simply because conceiving and
imagining, in its nature, <em>involves sequence</em> (i.e. it is linear
from the point of view of this new hierarchy, and as such pertains
solely to the reflexive hierarchy). So, although hierarchy of awareness
cannot go ‘under’ or ‘in front’ of the immediate-and-reflexive
experience, as we noted above, it can always come ‘closer’ than it is.<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The point is that these two
hierarchies <em>do not touch</em> or <em>overlap</em>, they are
<em>perpendicular</em>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> When we say ‘hierarchy of
awareness’, this should not be understood in a sense that one is always
aware. On the contrary, revealing this hierarchy requires effort, which
is being manifested through the practice of mindfulness. Nevertheless,
this hierarchy <em>exists</em>, and because of that the whole other
reflexive hierarchy is possible (see above). The difficulty lies in the
fact that this hierarchy cannot be <em>directly</em> grasped, and that
is because any notions of directionality originate from it.</p>
<p>The description made so far refers to the experience as a whole in an
<em>ideal</em> sense, i.e. the structure of experience has been
described and this structure is the same in <em>arahant</em> and
<em>puthujjana</em>. The difficulty is that the experience is, when we
reflect upon it, already affected with ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>).
Ultimately, ignorance is nothing but the <em>non-seeing</em> of the
nature of superimposition of the two hierarchies. Things are further
complicated by the fact that even reflexive hierarchy is not a simple
order of different levels of generality of things; even in this
hierarchy, those levels are, in a way, superimposed in relation to each
other, and they are all ‘kept together’, so to speak, by the fact that
they can all be <em>attended</em> to from the perspective of the
hierarchy of awareness. This hierarchy unifies them, determines them or
‘keeps them together’. Here we can recognize the nature of determination
(<em>saṅkhāra</em>), which, as the Suttas tell us, exist through the
presence of ignorance (<em>avijjāpaccayā saṅkhāra</em>). Thus, when one
is not free from igorance, the nature of the hierarchy of awareness is
not understood and because of that, that hierarchy will be implicitly
taken <em>par value</em>, as a kind of owner-creator of the reflexive
one, i.e. of our experience. This hierarchy of awareness appears as
being <em>towards</em> the reflexive hierarchy, as if ‘pressing’ in the
direction of it.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Simply by not-seeing that it is
directly dependent upon the reflexive hierarchy, this ‘pressing’ of the
hierarchy of awareness is being followed at its face value, and one
comes to <em>assume and accept</em> that offered ownership over one’s
own experience,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, i.e. one comes to assume that there
actually <em>is</em> Self.</p>
<p>This is perhaps overly-simplified. As we said earlier on, the
reflexive hierarchy generates the presence of the hierarchy of
awareness. This in return, simultaneously determines reflexive hierarchy
as such. However, since there is no first moment of ignorance being
manifested, both of those hierarchies are affected by it, through and
through. The hierarchy of awareness appears as somehow ‘in between’ our
reflexive levels of experience, and that is what Ven. Ñāṇavīra meant by
saying that they are perpendicular (see footnote 2). As a result of the
presence of ignorance, this ‘owner’ which we mentioned above also
appears like something which is <em>somewhere within</em> our
experience, ‘neither here nor there’. This elusiveness is maintained by
the lack of one’s capability of an indirect approach,<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> and
as a result this ‘owner’ becomes identified with reflexive or immediate
or reflexive-and-immediate or non-reflexive-nor-immediate aspects of
life. In structural terms, simply not seeing this ‘towards’ of the
hierarchy of awareness, makes the experience distorted, and following it
means that one is going ‘with the grain’—<em>anuloma</em>. Only, when
‘towards’ is <em>indirectly</em> seen as being <em>directly</em>
dependent upon things which are impermanent, then the hierarchy of
awareness will lose its ‘pressure’ and remain standing there, “cut off
at the root, like a palm stump.” (MN 72 / i, 487) At this point the
actual hierarchy is <em>paṭiloma</em>, ‘against the grain’,
i.e. ‘towards’ is seen as impermanent and because of that it ceases to
be the <em>reason of one’s actions</em>, i.e. Self is destroyed.</p>
<p>Thus, Self is the reason for the existence of Self, i.e. both
reflexion and immediacy are equally affected by it. Only when
reflexion-and-immediacy are seen as a whole as being determined by
something else, the nature of the Self becomes revealed, which is that
it is <em>not-Self</em> (neither owner nor master). Thus, that
<em>thing</em> which was regarded as Self, does not disappear upon
realization of <em>anicca</em> and <em>dukkha</em>, it ‘changes
direction’, so to speak, and becomes not-Self, <em>anattā</em>. However,
even then, the thing remains there and what disappears is Self-view,<a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and that is because the hierarchy of
awareness has lost its ‘pressure’;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> thus certain
assumptions in regard to reflexive hierarchy disappear.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>For more on this subject see CtP, L. 93, pp. 351f. It is
not possible to clarify the point any further, simply because of the
nature of the subject. When one reflects, in a strict sense (i.e.
reflexion), one is <em>aware</em>. What is then present in one’s
experience is hierarchy of awareness <em>together</em> with those things
that were reflected upon, i.e. revealed by reflexion.<a href="#fnref1"
