<p>Practising the mindfulness of breathing correctly, means practising
the mindfulness of death correctly.</p>
<p>The Buddha has offered mindfulness of breathing as a replacement for
the practice of mindfulness of death. That was because mindfulness of
death pushed some monks over the edge, so to speak. It made them wish
for ending of their life before being fully awakened. Yet, it is
important to note that mindfulness of breath aims at the <em>same</em>
result as mindfulness of death does. That result is dispassion towards
the world and life (of sensuality) in general. The mindfulness of
breathing was a direct response to the need for rapid dispassion of
those committed to its practice. This of course doesn’t mean that
mindfulness of death was wrong, but it means that mindfulness of breath
is simply less risky. It cannot be stressed enough though – they both
aim at the same result.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this applies for any other “meditation” that we find in
Suttas. They might sound very different, but their aim is the same: the
establishment of mindfulness. Mindfulness to the extent necessary for
the discernment of Dhamma. Thus, we can say that if someone’s meditation
is not bringing them closer to <em>understanding</em> of sensuality and
experience of dispassion – that meditation is wrong.</p>
<p>The breath can end at any given moment, and we wouldn’t be able to do
anything about it. Random organ failure, heart attack, lung collapse,
none of these things would be accessible to our will power, yet, our
entire life (that same “will power”) directly and simultaneously depends
on it. For example, if something were to happen to the vital functions
of our body, our life would end that very moment. Regardless of where
our hopes and intentions were aiming at the time. This recognition can
be very unpleasant for an average inauthentic man of the world and it
could result in the experience of a tremendous fear and dread. It is the
aim of the mindfulness of death to cut through the manifold layers of
that inauthenticity. But, as the Buddha has himself seen, it can
sometimes be too much to handle; if a person realizes one’s own
mortality too fast and is not prepared for it. Hence the mindfulness of
breathing comes as a more gradual replacement. A replacement that still,
very much, leads in the same direction of recognizing the inherent
insecurity of one’s own life. This insecurity manifests through
realizing the impermanence of breath, <em>while</em> one mindfully
breathes. So, the difference between mindfulness of breath and
mindfulness of death is not in its “object”, but in a <em>point of
view.</em> (or where the mindfulness is anchored in).</p>
<p>In ‘death meditation’ the point of view is in one’s <em>sense of
Self</em>. This is more “personal” approach (which is why it is sharper,
quicker, and thus <em>riskier</em>). In ‘breath meditation’ the point of
view is placed on the <em>intentional act of breathing</em>. By doing
so, one’s sense of Self is not in the direct center of the experience.
(as opposed to the thought “<em>I</em> <em>will</em> die”, for example).
Either way, one can realize that no matter how volitional an act (of
breathing) might be, it is fundamentally rooted away from one’s control.
(Control that is the exemplification of one’s sense of Self.). This
becomes clear when one recognizes that <em>while</em> breathing, the
body (or the lungs, or heart, etc.) could stop working. They
<em>could</em> fail. That whole dimension, where the failure would come
from, would remain entirely “inaccessible” to one’s intentions and will.
No amount of one’s volition would be able to “cross” that threshold of
control that is determined by the present body that is simply “able to
breath”. (i.e. unobstructed airways, functioning lungs, beating heart,
etc.). In simple terms: one’s sense of control, intentions, will, sense
of Self, are all bound up with presently arisen functioning body. And
the <em>presence</em> of that body is not accessible to one’s will. (If
it were so, we wouldn’t be susceptible to illness, aging and death.).
Recognition of that lack of access to the fundamental aspects of one’s
own life, is the recognition of <em>impermanence</em>. Thus, in
mindfulness of breathing, one exposes oneself to the sharp truth of
<em>anicca</em>, but without winding oneself up through the anxious
contemplation of death.</p>
<p>We can go as far as to say that one’s life is <em>completely</em>
rooted outside one’s own sense of control. In other words, one’s ability
to exercise will and control, is something that one has no control over.
For example: if something random, (an accident or, a disease,) were to
simply block the air passages, no amount of intentional breathing would
be able to help us. Yet, our whole life would depend on it.</p>
<p>Correctly discerning this, results in the <em>right</em> dispassion.
And that means having no desire for either life or death.</p>
<p>The reason why this is very important to see is that many people use
a mere pleasure that they derive from meditation as a criterion for
their progress. But, pleasure is secondary, and is not something an
unawakened being should use to judge things against. Pleasure is not the
measure of success, it’s the unshakeable composure of peace in the face
of death, that is. Thus, one’s meditation of breath should establish
itself upon mindfulness of the impermanence as described above. It
should not become something agreeable that one uses for not dealing with
the world.</p>
<p>A dying man can only rely upon his wisdom, if he developed it. Wisdom
is not dependent upon any phenomenon originated upon six senses. It is
developed on the basis of the <em>discernment</em> of the same. That’s
why when one’s senses start to wither and die, the knowledge of their
nature remains unaffected. When there is no wisdom, there will be
despair, in the face of death.</p>
