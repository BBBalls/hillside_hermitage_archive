<p><em>If I experience a painful feeling in relation to a bodily
sensation, such as a backache, should I then just leave that ache alone
without trying to get rid of it, so that my craving and suffering
diminish?</em></p>
<p>If your attitude behind your action is not one of craving, then you
can do whatever it takes to heal the backache. Lay down, take an
ibuprofen, etc.</p>
<p>Using medicines or trying to heal the body doesn’t have to involve
craving, but it will unless you know the Middle way (non-lust,
non-aversion, non-distraction) to escape from craving.</p>
<p>Pain can be managed, but one must do so in such a way that uproots
one’s suffering (the starving of craving) rather than managing one’s
suffering (the feeding of craving).</p>
<p>By no longer acting out of craving, which you have been doing
habitually since you can remember, you can begin to discern the nature
of that attitude of craving, which does not disappear as soon as you
decide to stop following it. As one becomes aware of craving, one
becomes aware of suffering in all its gory details. It feels pretty
intense and seems like it’s going to last forever. No ibuprofen or
physical relaxation is going to help with that suffering. The point is
that you can manage your physical pain without feeding your
suffering.</p>
<p>When you don’t act out of craving, you will discover its true nature.
You get to see the extent of <em>Dukkha</em>.</p>
<p>Now, any act of craving, no matter how small, will fuel that dukkha
and keep you confined within it. Any management of that suffering will
keep you liable to the management of suffering. The only escape lies in
‘patient endurance’- the Middle way. In other words, the dukkha must be
experienced without adding more fuel to its fire, and as long as the
craving persists, it’s going to burn.</p>
<p>Trying to find a way to manage that suffering is inevitable. Likewise
with wanting to get rid of it. And if you manage not to do that, you
will come face to face with dukkha, which will seem everlasting. The
goal, however, is not to be moved by it, to no longer be affected even
if it is the most severe suffering you can imagine, even if it feels
like it will last forever. Dukkha must be overcome, and in order to do
that, you have to adopt this ‘middle way of non-craving’ attitude.</p>
<p>This non-doing of craving is one of the hardest things to accomplish.
Nevertheless, if you keep trying, you can eventually find the right
balance and at that <em>point</em>, you must stay, until there is no
longer a problem with dukkha. Which means it’s no longer dukkha.</p>
