<p>Mindfulness done correctly is when the mind is <em>anchored</em> in
something. That something must be a thing that is not directly attended
to, but instead, has to be a <em>reference point</em> to the attended
thing (hence we call it “anchor”). If a thing is not directly attended
to but there, we call that thing to be a “background”. It’s a background
to a thing we attend (which makes that thing a “foreground”). This is
the basic principle of mindfulness, on which we can expand here
below.</p>
<p>One begins developing this practice of awareness by being mindful of
the experience as a <em>whole</em>. For example, one is mindful of
‘being-seated-on-a-chair-reading-a-Dhamma-essay’. That is one’s
<em>situation</em> at that very time. That is one’s experience as a
“whole”. This is always the necessary starting point. What is very
important is to prevent the tendency to become absorbed in one
particular thing. (Feeling, sensations or perception, and similar).
Instead, one has to broaden the mindfulness and become aware of the
<em>generality</em> of one’s current situation, without losing the sight
of the particular either.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course, the attempts of discerning the background of one’s current
experience will not be perfect in the beginning. One will more often
than not fall into a mistake of over-attending one’s experience as a
whole. This is a mistake of making that background into an
<em>object</em> of one’s attention, defining it, clarifying it, trying
to keep it in front. These are all ways of making it a
<em>foreground</em>, which means that then something else will be in
place of the background.</p>
<p>The natural tendency is to ask “<em>What</em> is then the
background?”. This is however a wrong question. And it’s wrong because
we are not concerned with the <em>content</em> of the background (or
foreground for that matter), which would be the answer to “what?”.
Instead our concern should be with <em>nature</em> of it. So one needs
to restrain the tendency to clarify <em>what</em> is that “background”,
and learn how to start discerning the domain of it. The domain of the
“<em>periphery</em>”, its nature, in regard to what is presently
<em>enduring</em> here.</p>
<p>Thus, something one attends to directly is what a foreground is at
the time. It can be anything that is the current object of one’s
attention. That thing has manifested, and it is enduring as such. That’s
the basic structural property of one’s experience, there is no problem
with this. However, if one wants to develop mindfulness, a step further
is necessary. That step is developing the peripheral “vision” in regard
to that very same foreground object, but <em>without</em> making that
peripheral vision the new object by <em>directly</em> attending to it.
The Buddha referred to this as “<em>yoniso manasikara</em>”, which is
often translated as “proper attention”. <em>Yoniso manasikara</em> is
the correct way of attending to the peripheral. <em>Manasikara</em>
means “attention”. <em>Yoni</em> means “womb”. So when a thing is
present in the front, in the foreground, its peripheral background is
that very “womb” the thing has “came from”, so to speak. <em>Yoniso
manasikara</em> is womb-attention, or less literally: a peripheral
attention.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, the point is to learn <em>how</em> to attend. Not so much
“what”. It’s about discerning the habit of “over-attending” and learning
how to not resort to it. This habit manifests through either indulging
or resisting the object of one’s attention. Either way, one is fully
concerned with it. This is why one must stop trying to “observe” one’s
experience as an object of one’s attention and instead, acknowledge it
and let it <em>endure</em> on its own. (Let it persist or
change-while-remaining-the-same-thing). Once the arisen experience of
one’s attention is allowed to be, then gradually and indirectly,
discerning of the peripheral <em>domain</em> can manifest.</p>
<p>The most practical way of practising this is through mindfulness of
body postures. That’s why these things are often called “foundations” of
mindfulness, or “anchors” or “reference points”. It’s because they are
<em>always</em> rooted in the <em>background</em>. (E.g. foundations are
<em>under</em>; an anchor is at the <em>bottom</em>; the reference point
is at the <em>distance</em>. Under, bottom, away… it means
‘not-here-directly-in-front-of-me’). So for example: while I’m seated,
I’m reading an article, actively scrolling through the pages, paying
attention to what’s being said in it. Things I’m “doing”, like reading,
writing, talking, etc. are things I’m attending to (foreground). And I’m
attending to them all <em>while</em> I’m <em>seated</em>. That’s the
reference point that is enough for proper mindfulness. That is what’s
the background here. Yet, if I switch my attention and start attending
to the fact that I’m sitting on the chair, then the body posture of
“sitting” ceases to be the background in my experience. Why? Because
I’ve broken the relationship of “referencing”. There is no more
“<em>while</em>”, since I forgot about the reading, and became concerned
with sitting. When this happens, one can either go back to the original
foreground, or discern the newly present background in regard to the
attended experience of sitting. The new background will have to be
something even more <em>general</em> than “sitting posture”. And the
more general thing in that case is nothing other than awareness of the
“body there”.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Body postures are more general than attending to a particular action
or perception. But having a “body <em>there</em>” is even more general
than the postures. Because to be walking, sitting, standing or lying
down, one needs to have a <em>body</em> in the first place. That’s why
one can also use the knowledge of “there is body”, as the peripheral
anchor for one’s daily actions and experiences. The presence of one’s
living body is a fundamental requirement for <em>any</em> action. We can
go even higher (even more general), as we mentioned earlier, and develop
awareness of the phenomenon of Earth, Water, Fire or Air. Or even
further, in the practice of more refined <em>kasinas</em>, as described
in the <em>Suttas</em>. The point is that the principle remains the
same.</p>
<p>We need to stress that this is something that requires
<em>development</em>. It’s not something that can be just “figured out”,
or read once and made sense of. It requires a diligent
<em>repetition</em> of “stepping back” when over-attending one’s
experience as a whole. And then “stepping in” when ignoring it
(under-attending it, forgetting about the background). So, it takes time
and effort in order for it to be correctly <em>discerned</em> and
<em>recognized</em>.</p>
<p>The problem with common practice of meditation is that people are
encouraged to get “absorbed” into the particular “meditation object”.
The practice becomes a form of focusing on the foreground at the expense
of everything else. And not just that, people end up focusing on the
objects twice as hard. This is because their view of meditation is to
look and <em>perceive</em> the “momentary” foreground (the whole idea of
“observing ‘<em>sensations</em>’”). Then within that they try to
perceive even more <em>particular</em> things. So it’s not just the
<em>domain</em> of the foreground, but the content proliferates further
too. In cases like this, the ‘background’, as a foundation of
mindfulness that needs to be understood, is even further obscured.</p>
<p>The ‘reference point’ means being aware of something, without having
to actively think about it. That’s the basic principle of mindfulness.
This should <em>always</em> be the basis for <em>samadhi</em> (according
to the <em>Suttas</em>).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> That is why, if mindfulness and
awareness is practised correctly, it will result in <em>knowledge</em>
of the nature of things. The very definition of knowledge is knowing
something without having to actively think about it. The knowledge
reappears when it is attended to. One knows what one knows. This is the
important point because this type of mindfulness of the background
that’s simultaneous with the presently arisen phenomenon<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>,
results in the establishment of mind (<em>samadhi</em>) that transcends
<em>sensuality</em> and <em>ill will</em>. The whole domain (scope) of
unwholesome.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> And that’s why that <em>samadhi</em>
further results in complete knowledge of liberation.</p>
<p>The catch is in persistent effort of repetition of <em>learning</em>
how to <em>attend</em> to things <em>peripherally</em>, without having
to “directly” look at them. For a mind affected with <em>avijja</em>,
the “direct look”, the “<em>ayoniso manasikara</em>” always involves
<em>appropriation</em> and the <em>Self-view</em>. And “learning to
attend” things peripherally can be done on many different “bases” or
“domains” that are structurally present as the background of our
attended experience. These domains are the domain of feelings, thoughts,
and even one’s intentions (bodily, verbal and mental).</p>
<p>For example, being aware of the <em>general feeling</em> present,
without trying to <em>perceive</em> it as “sensation” (i.e. “in” the
body), is another way of establishing the proper mindfulness.</p>
<p>Or, something we often talk about, taking up of personal
<em>responsibility</em>. If one takes it up, then no matter what the
engagement with the particular task is, the background of it (the “womb”
of that engagement) is one’s own <em>choice</em> to engage with it in
the first place. Taking up responsibility, means becoming aware of the
“background” choices one makes throughout one’s life.<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Furthermore, taking up responsibility for what one has chosen, a
person gets to maintain that mindfulness through the very particular
actions one is doing on account of it. And that mindfulness of
responsibility is not something they would have to perpetually think
about. No, that mindfulness is being <em>felt</em> instead. (That’s why
the initial awareness of <em>any</em> form of responsibility is always
<em>unpleasant</em> and concerning).</p>
<p>The choice behind one’s actions is a general <em>unity</em>, a
<em>context</em> of one’s acts, that is present in each of those acts
individually. Present as a peripheral background. It is because of this
that <em>sila</em> or <em>virtue</em> is a necessary prerequisite for
understanding. When one’s actions are based on <em>distortions</em> of
priority (particular sensuality <em>over</em> general nature of choice
regarding it, for example), one cannot see a clear responsible
background while engaged in such pursuits. No perspective, so to speak.
So, first actions that maintain absorptions with particularity must be
divorced from the unwholesome domain. Then they must be further
restrained, by avoiding the distracting of oneself. By undoing wrong way
of attending to things. By not cultivating improper attention. Only then
can one begin to discern the <em>signs</em> of the peripheral,
characteristics of the background hereby discussed. Only then one will
be able to “grasp the sign of one’s mind” or <em>cittanimitta</em>. A
necessary requirement for the arising of the Right view.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>This is why the correct practice of mindfulness results
in higher establishments of mind (<em>samadhi</em>). For example, this
is where mind surmounts the fundamental “generality” of form, by the way
of surmounting the generality of earth, water, fire and air. Also, there
is a reason that the order of elements always stays the same. They are
have a particular structural order of their generality. And one can
discern them in that order only.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
