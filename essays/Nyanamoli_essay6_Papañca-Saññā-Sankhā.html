<p>This compound has represented, to paraphrase John D. Ireland from his
Udāna translation notes, a stumbling block which even the ancient
commentaries find difficult to define. If the importance of the term is
to be deduced from the extent of its difficulty then indeed
understanding of this compound carries a lot of significance in regard
to grasping of the Buddha’s Teaching.</p>
<p>There are various translations of <em>papañca-saññā-sankhā</em>, with
currently the most prominent ones being either Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi’s
“notions [born of] mental proliferations” translating the term
<em>papañca</em> as ‘proliferation’; or Ven. Ñāṇamoli Thera’s
“calculations of perceptions of diversifications” where he renders
papañca as ‘diversification’. Beyond these two, plus the PTS Dictionary
definition, I am not familiar in detail with any other different
interpretations of this compound. I am aware that Ven. Ñāṇananda in his
“Concept and Reality in Early Buddhist Thought” addresses this topic to
a certain degree and also that Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi based his views of the
term upon this interpretation<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> but I, myself, have
never actually read Ven. Ñāṇananda’s book so my view on this matter will
come from perhaps, to some extent, a different angle.</p>
<p>To start with, the respective terms ‘diversification’ and
‘proliferation’ do not deviate from the meaning of <em>papañca</em>.
According to the PTS dictionary, <em>papañca</em> is “expansion,
diffuseness, manifoldedness” or “obstacle, hindrance or delay”. The
other members of the compound are defined as <em>saññā</em> (perception)
and <em>sankhā</em> (sign or characteristic). So the above-mentioned
translations would, to some degree, convey the nature of
<em>papañca-saññā-sankhā</em> quite accurately and, as Ven. Bhikkhu
Bodhi says in <em>The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha</em><a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> (endnote no. 229, p. 1204-5), “no
rendering [of this compound] is utterly beyond doubt”. The question
which raises itself then is not how to etymologically trace the exact
roots and origination of the compound, since such, a task in this case
proves impossible in the absolute sense (and many seem to agree with
this). Rather, it is better to focus and try to find out <em>within</em>
one’s own experience and practice what is implied existentially and
phenomenologically in the Suttas by this term.</p>
<p>At the risk of being incomprehensible on some points, I would try to
use ‘descriptive’ language, rather than overly technical terms as
people’s general views are already quite firm in regard to such
terminology and it is very likely that they will be coming from a quite
different place than me, probably <em>too</em> different which could
obstruct them from understanding what I’m trying to say. In order to
reduce this possibility to a minimum I thought of using some more common
terms in my descriptions which carry less chance of being misunderstood.
I hope I won’t miss the mark too much.</p>
<p>Those familiar with phenomenology and the philosophy of existence
should not have any problems in understanding a statement like all our
experience is intentional or teleological or simply—significant. Each
thing (<em>dhamma</em>) which is being experienced in our everyday life
has, as its <em>inherent nature</em>, to point to other thing(s), within
the experience as a whole. The thing’s significance is not something
‘steady’ or ‘inchangeable’, although it often might appear so. The
significance of a thing is, rather, something which is being
<em>acquired</em> through the <em>repetition</em> of the respective
experiences of that very thing. During this, the whole perception of a
thing comes to ‘grow’ in a course of time, so to speak, and though there
are certainly significances which are <em>recognized</em> as common to
all people, at a more fundamental level they are all
<em>individually</em> acquired and carried by each of us<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Without going into greater details let us say that in the Suttas this
intentionality of experience is what is meant by the statement “with the
grain” or <em>anuloma</em>. Actually, it is probably better to be more
precise and to re-qualify this and say: taking for granted this
intentionality, holding it and appropriating it, makes this
<em>with</em> of “with the grain” to appear. In the <em>arahant</em>’s
case, the ignorance is completely destroyed, yet the grain still
remains, i.e. things <em>do not</em> stop pointing to other things, but
this ‘with’ ceases to exist and is being replaced by ‘against’ as a
result of which we get “against the grain”—<em>patiloma</em>. What has
changed is the fundamental <em>direction</em> of regarding this very
<em>directionality of experience.</em> Thus, even in the case of
complete liberation things continue to be teleological or ‘with purpose’
so they still point to other things and so on. All this is being
mentioned for the reason that the term <em>papañca</em> is probably too
often misunderstood to simply mean ‘mental proliferation’, ‘when one
thinks or analyzes too much’ or something like that. Although these
things do imply <em>papañca</em> (or to be more precise ignorance and
desire-and-lust), the above said nevertheless shows us that if
<em>papañca</em> is anything, it is certainly more fundamental than
that. In support of this we may add that <em>papañca</em> is frequently
linked with <em>maññanā</em>, ‘conceving’ (for which see Mūlapariyāya
Sutta, MN 1) which certainly represents the most fundamental
‘occurrence’ in a mind affected with ignorance. Thus, what
<em>papañca</em> would imply is nothing less than this very
<em>intentionality</em> of our experience and its <em>tendency</em> to
grow and expand. However this can happen only when that ‘with’ is
present i.e. when the mind is not free from the bonds of ignorance and
when it keeps following things in their appearance— “…his consciousness
flows after the sign of form [sound, smell, tastes, touches, thoughts],
is tied and shackled by gratification in the sign of form, if fettered
by the fetter of gratification…”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. And surely enough it is
said that the <em>arahant</em> is <em>nippapañca</em>—without
diversifications, free from any attachments (<em>upadhi</em>), free from
burden <em>accumulated</em> in the past.</p>
<p>Thus, one’s world (everything which appears—<em>nāma-rūpa</em>),
expands. One’s views, desires etc. expand too, yet this should not be
understood in a momentary sense, which would suggest that they will
somehow ‘shrink’ afterwards<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> by themselves. Their
<em>intensity</em> or the <em>intensity of their presence</em>, once
‘accumulated’ i.e. came to being, is being ‘assumed’ or ‘held’
(<em>upādāna</em>) at that (new) face value. When this happens—and it
happens through the repetition of [ignorant] actions as said
above—consciousness “becomes established” upon that <em>degree of
presence</em>, which then becomes the <em>actual experience</em> of that
<em>thing</em>. Thus, the intensity of experience, that which appears as
<em>nāma-rūpa</em> grows (for more details see Mahānidāna Sutta, DN 15
[ii,63]). This kind of pattern stretches from the most fundamental
levels of our existence (as seen in Mūlapariyāya Sutta), up to the
coarsest ones which we might say are, “resorting to rods and weapons, of
quarrels, brawls, disputes, recrimination, malicious words and false
speech<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>…”, that is <em>the directly painful
actions resulting from one’s ignorance</em>. Thus, based on the above,
<em>papañca</em> represents the ‘diffusion’ of this fundamental
underlying principle with ignorance being <em>necessarily present</em>,
and consequently <em>papañca-saññā-sankhā</em> are all ‘calculations’ or
‘notions’, perceived and originated as a result of taking this principle
of diffusion for granted i.e. not understanding it.</p>
<p>To conclude, it is worth mentioning that this whole situation would
be much clearer if we can bear in mind Ven. Ñāṇavīra Thera’s description
of the infinite hierarchy of consciousness, the different levels of
generality of <em>nāma-rūpa</em>—<em>viññāṇa</em>. That is because
<em>papañca-saññā-sankhā</em> is not something which appears on a
voluntary level, as if one could stop it at any time; it stretches from
the most general (reflexive) levels of existence<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>.
What one is responsible for, in that whole structure, is “delighting in,
welcoming and holding to…” the “source through which perceptions and
notions [born of] mental proliferation beset a man…”<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.
Thus the hierarchy of signifying things continues to arise (cease and
change-while-standing) but it no longer grows; it is “cut off at the
root, made like a palm stump”. Its root was ignorance in itself and with
its absence everything founded upon it comes to an end—one is free. In
other words the respective experiences of the <em>puthujjana</em> and
<em>arahant</em> alike, share the same fundamental nature of
impermanence (arising and ceasing) but the respective
<em>intensities</em> of those experiences are changed; for the
<em>arahant feeling none</em> of it)<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and for the
<em>puthujjana</em> dependant on the amount of ignorance being present.
More ignorance, more ‘intensity’, things appear as more ‘pressing’ and
one is easily prone to giving in to desire-and-lust. The arising of
things in the <em>puthujjana</em>’s mind brings diffusion of perceptions
and notions which, while not understood at its roots, will in return
diffuse further and further and so on. This cannot happen in the
<em>arahant</em>’s mind any more. His consciousness has ‘ceased’ so
there is nothing to follow and diversify upon this teleological
characteristic of the existential structure, which will remain only
until his aggregates ‘break apart’.</p>
