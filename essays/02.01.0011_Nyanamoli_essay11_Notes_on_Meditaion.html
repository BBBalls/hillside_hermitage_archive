<p>– Ānāpānasati Sutta (MN 118)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1. The practice of ānāpānasati or mindfulness of breathing represents
a phenomenological exercise in developing the principle of simultaneity
(akālikā dhamma). This is accomplished by the sufficient establishing of
mindfulness and knowledge of what one is supposed to do and discern.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It is an exercise because it
requires one actively engaging in and being aware of the act of
breathing, and it develops the principle of simultaneity because while
one is actively breathing, one is aware of one’s actions (body,
feelings, and thoughts). These are two different, simultaneously present
things: the physical or bodily act of breathing, and the mental
reflexive thoughts of one doing that very act. One is not supposed to be
favoured on account of the other; a person should not be overdoing the
breathing (i.e. turning it into a forceful breathing exercise) nor
should he be underdoing it (i.e. forgetting about the act of breathing
that is being performed, and letting it happen unawares). In the same
sense one should not overthink one’s thinking (i.e. get lost in
thought). The point is to mindfully breathe while remaining fully aware
of oneself-mindfully-breathing, or – to put it simply – to remain aware
of the present phenomenon of “I am breathing.”</p>
<p>2. Breathing is an intentional action, not a habit, and there is
volition involved in every single breath a person takes. The reason why
most people think breathing is an automated process is because they are
almost never aware of it. Thus the intentional side of the breath
remains obscured.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> By being an act (kamma), it has
potential, if understood as such, to reveal the nature of all acts
(present, future and past), of everything one has ever intentionally
done and planning to do. By being an intentional act, breathing shares
the same universal nature as all good and evil actions in this world.
The reason why breathing is such a suitable act for the practice of
mindfulness<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> is because it is an immediately
neutral action, there is no actual good or bad involved in it. Thus,
although it shares the same nature as all these other more “kammically”
(and consequentially) engaging acts, there are no future results
involved that would pertain to oneself and others. The merit of an
in-breath ceases with an out-breath.</p>
<p>3. As we see from the opening excerpt, by “training oneself thus…,” a
monk develops mindfulness of both immediate and possible action (kamma):
“I breathe in/out (thus)…,” and “(thus) I shall breathe in/out….” This
kind of mindfulness when developed leaves nothing out, and one is
simply, yet steadily, becoming more aware of the nature of action in
general while that very action is actually present. Ultimately of
course, this leads to the full transparency of that “I”, in that
experience of breathing as a whole, and it’s utterly redundant nature
that is being gratuitously assumed.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> This nature, if
mindfulness pursued to the extent necessary,<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> can
eventually be completely understood and the gratuitous “I” destroyed.
This, however, should not be taken in a sense that the phenomenon of “I”
would disappear like it was never there, but in a sense that that “I”
will cease to be “me” and “mine”. It will remain just standing there,
hollow and dry.</p>
<p>4. The reason why it is recommended that one should sit when
exercising mindfulness of breathing is because such a posture offers the
least distractions to one’s mind. When seated, one will not be engaging
in any other action different from breathing (and passively sitting of
course). So, the only thing that one is going to be doing is breathing.
In this way it can be understood that sitting is the most optimal
posture to have, so that one wouldn’t be wasting any effort.
Consequently, with the further development of the discernment of the
simultaneously present phenomena, and with the strengthening of
mindfulness, one can more freely assume other postures and not remain
confined to sitting alone. Furthermore, even engaging in other acts, for
example: “while breathing, I am sweeping the floor,” will not be a
distraction for one’s mindfulness in any way. In this particular
instance, one’s mindfulness and discernment is divided, or shared by,
two simultaneously present actions (sweeping and breathing), while one
is also simultaneously aware of that thing as a whole. And this division
can continue as far as the strength of one’s mindfulness allows, though
there is no particular benefit and reason in pushing it.</p>
<p>5. Sometimes people assume that in ānāpānasati one is mindful of the
“body of breath,” as opposed to just one’s (experience of) body.<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> This rendering comes from the
confusion and lack of phenomenological insight into the nature of the
(appearing) body. If one is to understand that whether it is the
ordinary experience of one’s body in everyday existence, or an unusual
one resulting from the new practice of concentration, or even a strange
sense of lightness of one’s body on drugs, in phenomenological terms –
body is just there. Thus, again, regardless of the particular way one’s
body presents itself, it is the phenomenon of the body that is present,
and that’s what one should be concerned with. So, when practising
mindfulness of breathing, one actually devotes direct attention to the
‘act of breathing,’ that body (or that strange-sense-of-body) that
emerges as a phenomenon, peripherally, is that which is the body, in
that experience right then and there. In this way one experiences one’s
body through an act of breathing, which is why the Buddha said that
body, as one of the foundations of mindfulness, is brought to
fulfillment in the practice of ānāpānasati.<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>By being able to see peripherally that which appears as peripheral,
but simultaneously present, one does not conceive it. It is the
intention in regard to the peripheral,<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>
which tends to make things actual<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> that carries
appropriation. If one succeeds in leaving it peripheral (i.e. the way it
has arisen), one is practicing mindfulness correctly. The tendency
towards ‘conceivings’ will slowly fade when the mindfulness reaches the
necessary extent. Again, knowledge of what the conceiving is (i.e. not
understanding the phenomenon of simultaneously and dependently present
and leaving it as such), is an absolute requirement, because without it
this whole practice won’t bear fruits of any fundamental importance.
However, even a puthujjana, by trying to understand what the correct
practice of mindfulness is, might actually understand it, and then cease
to be a puthujjana, so this whole practice should be encouraged
regardless.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>6. The contemporary Buddhist outlook usually equates the practice of
ānāpānasati with the practice of jhānas, and if not regarded as the
same, it is too often thought that by practicing ānāpānasati one will by
default “enter” a jhāna. I suspect this assumption stems from the
commentarial times, whereby various meditation techniques, that revolve
around the idea of the mindfulness of breathing, were concocted and
advertised as something that would directly lead to the experience of
jhānas.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Jhānas are the establishments of mind, and as such they are to be
developed upon the sufficient degree of mindfulness, which in return can
be established upon various different things, ānāpānasati being one of
them.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Thus, it should be clear, that the
practice of jhāna is a fundamentally different practice from
ānāpānasati. While ānāpānasati shares a nature of the phenomenological
exercise of one’s actions in regard to body, feelings, mind and
thoughts, jhāna is less of that, but more of an establishment of one’s
mind upon a certain way of attending to things (in this case upon a
phenomenological surmounting of the sensual domain), and the discernment
involved therein. In other words, by understanding what jhāna is, one
enters it,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> not by performing a set of
prescribed motions that somehow make it “happen” to one.</p>
<p>Obviously, one can develop and establish an unwavering mindfulness
through the practice of ānāpānasati, and once established one could
change one’s outlook and with such mindfulness recognize the extent of
sensuality, as a phenomenon, and what exactly it entails, and by doing
so step outside of it, so to speak. In this way one would enter the
first jhāna, where that mindfulness would remain fully established and
can be developed even further.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> It is clear here that
it is not that ānāpānasati in itself took one automatically into a
jhāna, but that the change of attending to things did,<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>
once the mindfulness was strong enough. Furthermore, jhāna is not taught
as a goal in itself, as Kāyagatāsati Sutta (MN 119) tells us, but as one
of the forms that can bring one’s mindfulness to the necessary
fulfillment.</p>
<p>So, in order for any of these paragraphs to be intelligible, one will
have to abandon the notions of “meditation techniques” and all the
contemporary ideas of the practice of concentration, which is usually
taught at the expense of mindfulness and with underlying wrong views
(such as mystical absorptions and novelty experiences that then become a
measure of one’s “success”). When a person hears the term ānāpānasati,
he will be better o thinking “development of mindfulness” – the same
mindfulness that he has to varying extents in his day-to-day
experiences.</p>
<p>7. “Meditation techniques” are usually sets of fairly random motions
and performances, idiosyncratic to the particular meditation teacher,
that require one to fol ow certain prescribed steps which if performed
correctly, and with some luck, will make one experience “something”.
Often, in return, that same teacher would have to “interpret” back these
experiences for one.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly: if one needs to be told by another what the
significance of one’s experience was, this means one has not understood
it by oneself. It means one is still concerned with the particular
aspects (i.e. the random contents) of one’s meditation experience, and
one fails to see the general nature of it all. As a result, any external
interpretation is regarded as an explanation, which means that
phenomenology remains buried deep down under layers of preconceived
ideas and assumptions. This holds true even more when it comes to the
idea of “attainments”, which are also regarded as experiences that
“happen” to one, almost against one’s will and as a result of “a very
good technique” one has employed. There is a concealed irony there that
escapes such people, because if one needs to be “confirmed” a sotāpanna,
for example, by one’s teacher, this means one doesn’t know that one
actually is a sotāpanna, which means that one can still doubt it, which
in return means that one is not freed from the fetter of doubt, i.e.
actually not a sotāpanna. The irony is further amplified if the teacher
goes ahead and “confirms” one. If one is to actually understand what
“being free from doubt” (and the other two fetters, characteristic of
the sotāpanna) is, one would realize how non-applicable any external
affirmation or denial is.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>How obstructive to phenomenology (i.e. mindfulness) this whole way of
practising is, can be seen from the nature of understanding. One
understands things when one understands them, when the knowledge in
regard to the nature of an arisen thing is there, and not when one
successfully goes through a set of methods and observances that relies
on an almost mechanical set of motions one has to perform attentively.
Any bodily act and any act that pertains to the bodily domain (such as
the celebrated and misguided notion of “sensations”<a href="#fn17"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
which involve observing different parts and aspects of one’s body) is
simply irrelevant for the discerning of the nature of an arisen
phenomenon.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> It is misleading and obstructive,
because it is impossible to engage in a technique without the implicit
belief that a set of motions, that the chosen technique consists of,
performed in a particular mechanical order, will somehow, by itself,
reveal the nature of things. By holding this belief and faith in a
technique, one will not be trying to understand things, and by not
making attempts toward the understanding, one will definitely remain
devoid of it.</p>
<p>One sees things correctly – as phenomena – by understanding what the
phenomenon is, and there is no technique that can make this magically
occur. Thus, the closest to what one should do in order to obtain
understanding is: trying to understand. For as long as a person is
attempting to understand and see the nature of an arisen thing, that
person might actually succeed in it, for it is certain that
understanding cannot occur in someone who is not trying to understand.
Incidentally (or not), there is never any mention of meditation
techniques in the Suttas, but ‘understanding’ and ‘discernment’, as a
way to reach the final freedom from suffering, is described and referred
to countless times.</p>
<p>When one looks at the experience mindfully, it becomes apparent that
regardless of the content of the particular experience, the nature of
experience is present. So, whether it is the experience of
“impatiently-waiting-for-a-bus,” or the experience of tiredness after a
physical exertion, or strange and novel experience of a powerful light
that occurred in front of me while meditating on a seven-day
technique-based meditation retreat, all I should be concerned about is
that an experience is there and as such it needs to be understood.<a
href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> This means that investing effort
into meditation techniques is fundamentally a waste of time if one is
concerned with understanding the Dhamma, and the most one can accomplish
is relaxation, a sense of peace coming from withdrawal from the habitual
world of senses, or – worse – fortification of the wrong views based on
a misinterpretation of the nature of the novelty experiences. Either
way, the results of any technique one might engage in, will remain
worldly, and will draw its power from a temporary change of one’s
environment, one’s usual way of regarding things. In any case, the
“benefits” and “helpfulness” of a chosen technique will simply share the
nature of a phenomenon of novelty that one is experiencing. As such, it
means it will run out, and one will have to either do it harder, or
change the technique.</p>
<p>If people attend meditation retreats as a form of a temporary escape
from the busy and oppressing world, by all means they should do it, as
often as they can. However, rather than engaging in a practice of a
technique and “sensation watching,” they would be better o using their
quiet time in trying to understand the nature of things according to the
way the Buddha described it, whether sitting, walking or lying down. For
it is that “nature” which the Dhamma means and refers to, and anything
that is not dealing with this, or anything that is obscuring that very
nature (i.e. phenomena) of things, consequently is not the Dhamma, no
matter how “helpful” and “useful” it might be.<a href="#fn20"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>
In different words, one’s experience is phenomenological (i.e. the five
aggregates are all simultaneously present in their respective domains),
and this means that nature of things comes first,<a href="#fn21"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
before anything one does based on that nature. Doing a technique in
order to practice the Dhamma (i.e. see the nature of things) is like
exiting the house, so as to be in it. It’s a contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>8. In the first establishment of mind, the first jhāna, the
appropriation of the bodily action (intention) ceases. This is
accomplished when that thought, which in ordinary experience stands for
that which is the body (and anything originating from it) is seen in its
phenomenological nature, i.e. as thought,<a href="#fn22"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>
When the mind is thus established upon the signs and characteristics of
one’s thought, as an arisen thing, that thought is recognized as being
indifferent<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> to anything other than itself, such
as body and matter.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Through that very indifference, the
thought, even if it thinks about the body and anything bodily, ceases to
stand for ‘that’ which is the body (rūpa). This is why the first jhāna
is primarily characterized by thinking-and-pondering (vittakavicāra) and
it is also why the sensual domain (i.e. domain that is pertaining to the
body) has been surmounted. The result of this cessation is the subsiding
of speech – the physical, bodily aspect of it. By dropping the
appropriation of the bodily intention, through the surmounting of its
whole domain, one clearly sees the whole body as an independent thing,
just sitting there, already given. Even if one is to make a bodily
intention, one would see that intention too, as something that is
inevitably and inseparably confined to the bodily domain and as such: as
something that can never be “mine”. This is why the first establishment
of mind is also sufficient for the final knowledge.<a href="#fn25"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Furthermore, it is because of this very principle of thought ceasing
to ‘stand for’ that which is the body, that the jhānas are wholesome in
themselves, even if not accompanied by understanding. By “ceasing to
stand for” the wrong order of the experience is reversed, and the
structurally independent, simultaneously present and indifferent to each
other individual domains of the aggregates are experienced as they are,
without the distortion introduced by assumption in regard to them. This
is why the Buddha praised the practice of jhāna, because if the person
develops them correctly, even as a puthujjana, he would require very
little instruction in order to understand things and remove all
conceivings and avijjā.</p>

<li id="fn18"><p>In other words, it is impossible to perform an action
which in and by itself would be able to overcome the nature of action,
which is the whole point of the Buddhist practice: overcoming kamma.
Through action, good or bad or neutral, all one accomplishes is the
maintenance of the nature of action: by acting, one remains bound by
action. If this would not be the case, the Buddha and the Dhamma would
not be required for the freedom from suffering, and all one would have
to do is simply perform certain things and by doing so, automatically
reach nibbāna, or even better: all one would have to do is choose to be
in nibbāna and one would attain it.<a href="#fnref18"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>And one also comes to realize that for as long as one
is alive, experience is always there, and one doesn’t have to do
anything in order for it to be so. And this is where the real purpose of
a meditation technique becomes apparent: one is after a particular type
of experience (regarded as more desirable and lofty) as a form of
replacement or escape from another type of experience (regarded as
undesirable and unpleasant). “I want to experience this, I don’t want to
experience that (or lack-of-this). Thus, all one is trying to do is
experience pleasant by directly displacing unpleasant, i.e. one wants to
fulfill one’s immediate desire. For as long as one remains concerned and
puts value on the particulars of an experience, the nature of it will
remain unknown. This is the reason why any meditation of this kind is a
meditation that is utterly within the sensual domain and cannot go
beyond it, which is what MN 108 (iii, 14) refers to.<a href="#fnref19"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn20"><p>People themselves might often struggle to reconcile the
nature of meditation techniques with the nature of the Buddha’s
Teaching, but they usually end up ignoring this because it feels like
the immediate application of a technique is helping them and makes them
feel better. The problem with this is that they, as puthujjanas, have no
criteria to determine what “helpful” really is. Thus, they just end up
following their own feelings and assumptions again, but this time on the
pretext of Buddhism and spiritual practice.<a href="#fnref20"

<li id="fn21"><p>One can be ignorant of the phenomenological nature only
because that nature is there, present.<a href="#fnref21"

<li id="fn22"><p>Cf. my essay Not Perceiving the Feeling (Meanings,

<li id="fn23"><p>This is a type of structural indifference and this can
be understood in terms of the superimposition of the respective domains
of body (matter) and thoughts. Both of these domains are simultaneously
present, but they don’t interfere – they are “indifferent” to each
other. Furthermore, it is not just that they don’t interfere, it is that
they cannot interfere, even if one is to want it. This principle
actually applies to the whole experience, namely: the five aggregates.
Crossing from one domain into another is structurally inconceivable, but
as long as one does not fully understand that, by not-understanding one
conceives it. For more on this cf. my essays The Infinity of the Mind
and Not Perceiving the Feeling (Meanings, p. 39 and p.43).<a
