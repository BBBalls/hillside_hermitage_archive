<p>This compound has represented, to paraphrase John D. Ireland from his
Udāna translation notes, a stumbling block which even the ancient
commentaries find difficult to define. If the importance of the term is
to be deduced from the extent of its difficulty then indeed
understanding of this compound carries a lot of significance in regard
to grasping of the Buddha’s Teaching.</p>
<p>There are various translations of <span
lang="pi"><em>papañca-saññā-sankhā</em></span>, with currently the most
prominent ones being either Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi’s “notions [born of]
mental proliferations” translating the term <span
lang="pi"><em>papañca</em></span> as ‘proliferation’; or Ven. Ñāṇamoli
Thera’s “calculations of perceptions of diversifications” where he
renders papañca as ‘diversification’. Beyond these two, plus the PTS
Dictionary definition, I am not familiar in detail with any other
different interpretations of this compound. I am aware that Ven.
Ñāṇananda in his “Concept and Reality in Early Buddhist Thought”
addresses this topic to a certain degree and also that Ven. Bhikkhu
Bodhi based his views of the term upon this interpretation<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> but
I, myself, have never actually read Ven. Ñāṇananda’s book so my view on
this matter will come from perhaps, to some extent, a different
angle.</p>
<p>To start with, the respective terms ‘diversification’ and
‘proliferation’ do not deviate from the meaning of <span
lang="pi"><em>papañca</em></span>. According to the PTS dictionary,
<span lang="pi"><em>papañca</em></span> is “expansion, diffuseness,
manifoldedness” or “obstacle, hindrance or delay”. The other members of
the compound are defined as <span lang="pi"><em>saññā</em></span>
(perception) and <span lang="pi"><em>sankhā</em></span> (sign or
characteristic). So the above-mentioned translations would, to some
degree, convey the nature of <span
lang="pi"><em>papañca-saññā-sankhā</em></span> quite accurately and, as
Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi says in <cite>The Middle Length Discourses of the
Buddha</cite><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> (endnote no. 229, p. 1204-5), “no
rendering [of this compound] is utterly beyond doubt”. The question
which raises itself then is not how to etymologically trace the exact
roots and origination of the compound, since such, a task in this case
proves impossible in the absolute sense (and many seem to agree with
this). Rather, it is better to focus and try to find out <em>within</em>
one’s own experience and practice what is implied existentially and
phenomenologically in the Suttas by this term.</p>
<p>At the risk of being incomprehensible on some points, I would try to
use ‘descriptive’ language, rather than overly technical terms as
people’s general views are already quite firm in regard to such
terminology and it is very likely that they will be coming from a quite
different place than me, probably <em>too</em> different which could
obstruct them from understanding what I’m trying to say. In order to
reduce this possibility to a minimum I thought of using some more common
terms in my descriptions which carry less chance of being misunderstood.
I hope I won’t miss the mark too much.</p>
<p>Those familiar with phenomenology and the philosophy of existence
should not have any problems in understanding a statement like all our
experience is intentional or teleological or simply—significant. Each
thing (<span lang="pi"><em>dhamma</em></span>) which is being
experienced in our everyday life has, as its <em>inherent nature</em>,
to point to other thing(s), within the experience as a whole. The
thing’s significance is not something ‘steady’ or ‘inchangeable’,
although it often might appear so. The significance of a thing is,
rather, something which is being <em>acquired</em> through the
<em>repetition</em> of the respective experiences of that very thing.
During this, the whole perception of a thing comes to ‘grow’ in a course
of time, so to speak, and though there are certainly significances which
are <em>recognized</em> as common to all people, at a more fundamental
level they are all <em>individually</em> acquired and carried by each of
us<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Without going into greater details let us say that in the Suttas this
intentionality of experience is what is meant by the statement “with the
grain” or <span lang="pi"><em>anuloma</em></span>. Actually, it is
probably better to be more precise and to re-qualify this and say:
taking for granted this intentionality, holding it and appropriating it,
makes this <em>with</em> of “with the grain” to appear. In the <span
lang="pi"><em>arahant</em></span>‘s case, the ignorance is completely
destroyed, yet the grain still remains, i.e. things <em>do not</em> stop
pointing to other things, but this ’with’ ceases to exist and is being
replaced by ‘against’ as a result of which we get “against the
grain”—<span lang="pi"><em>patiloma</em></span>. What has changed is the
fundamental <em>direction</em> of regarding this very <em>directionality
of experience.</em> Thus, even in the case of complete liberation things
continue to be teleological or ‘with purpose’ so they still point to
other things and so on. All this is being mentioned for the reason that
the term <span lang="pi"><em>papañca</em></span> is probably too often
misunderstood to simply mean ‘mental proliferation’, ‘when one thinks or
analyzes too much’ or something like that. Although these things do
imply <span lang="pi"><em>papañca</em></span> (or to be more precise
ignorance and desire-and-lust), the above said nevertheless shows us
that if <span lang="pi"><em>papañca</em></span> is anything, it is
certainly more fundamental than that. In support of this we may add that
<span lang="pi"><em>papañca</em></span> is frequently linked with
<em>maññanā</em>, ‘conceving’ (for which see <cite>Mūlapariyāya Sutta,
MN 1</cite>) which certainly represents the most fundamental
‘occurrence’ in a mind affected with ignorance. Thus, what <span
lang="pi"><em>papañca</em></span> would imply is nothing less than this
very <em>intentionality</em> of our experience and its <em>tendency</em>
to grow and expand. However this can happen only when that ‘with’ is
present i.e. when the mind is not free from the bonds of ignorance and
when it keeps following things in their appearance— “…his consciousness
flows after the sign of form [sound, smell, tastes, touches, thoughts],
is tied and shackled by gratification in the sign of form, if fettered
by the fetter of gratification…”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. And surely enough it is
said that the <span lang="pi"><em>arahant</em></span> is <span
lang="pi"><em>nippapañca</em></span>—without diversifications, free from
any attachments (<span lang="pi"><em>upadhi</em></span>), free from
burden <em>accumulated</em> in the past.</p>
<p>Thus, one’s world (everything which appears—<span
lang="pi"><em>nāma-rūpa</em></span>), expands. One’s views, desires etc.
expand too, yet this should not be understood in a momentary sense,
which would suggest that they will somehow ‘shrink’ afterwards<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> by themselves. Their
<em>intensity</em> or the <em>intensity of their presence</em>, once
‘accumulated’ i.e. came to being, is being ‘assumed’ or ‘held’ (<span
lang="pi"><em>upādāna</em></span>) at that (new) face value. When this
happens—and it happens through the repetition of [ignorant] actions as
said above—consciousness “becomes established” upon that <em>degree of
presence</em>, which then becomes the <em>actual experience</em> of that
<em>thing</em>. Thus, the intensity of experience, that which appears as
<span lang="pi"><em>nāma-rūpa</em></span> grows (for more details see
<cite>Mahānidāna Sutta, DN 15 [ii,63]</cite>). This kind of pattern
stretches from the most fundamental levels of our existence (as seen in
Mūlapariyāya Sutta), up to the coarsest ones which we might say are,
“resorting to rods and weapons, of quarrels, brawls, disputes,
recrimination, malicious words and false speech<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>…”,
that is <em>the directly painful actions resulting from one’s
ignorance</em>. Thus, based on the above, <span
lang="pi"><em>papañca</em></span> represents the ‘diffusion’ of this
fundamental underlying principle with ignorance being <em>necessarily
present</em>, and consequently <span
lang="pi"><em>papañca-saññā-sankhā</em></span> are all ‘calculations’ or
‘notions’, perceived and originated as a result of taking this principle
of diffusion for granted i.e. not understanding it.</p>
<p>To conclude, it is worth mentioning that this whole situation would
be much clearer if we can bear in mind Ven. Ñāṇavīra Thera’s description
of the infinite hierarchy of consciousness, the different levels of
generality of <span lang="pi"><em>nāma-rūpa</em></span>—<span
lang="pi"><em>viññāṇa</em></span>. That is because <span
lang="pi"><em>papañca-saññā-sankhā</em></span> is not something which
appears on a voluntary level, as if one could stop it at any time; it
stretches from the most general (reflexive) levels of existence<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. What one is responsible for, in
that whole structure, is “delighting in, welcoming and holding to…” the
“source through which perceptions and notions [born of] mental
proliferation beset a man…”<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>. Thus the hierarchy of
signifying things continues to arise (cease and change-while-standing)
but it no longer grows; it is “cut off at the root, made like a palm
stump”. Its root was ignorance in itself and with its absence everything
founded upon it comes to an end—one is free. In other words the
respective experiences of the <span lang="pi"><em>puthujjana</em></span>
and <span lang="pi"><em>arahant</em></span> alike, share the same
fundamental nature of impermanence (arising and ceasing) but the
respective <em>intensities</em> of those experiences are changed; for
the <span lang="pi"><em>arahant</em></span> <em>feeling none</em> of
it<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and for the <span
lang="pi"><em>puthujjana</em></span> dependant on the amount of
ignorance being present. More ignorance, more ‘intensity’, things appear
as more ‘pressing’ and one is easily prone to giving in to
desire-and-lust. The arising of things in the <span
lang="pi"><em>puthujjana</em></span>‘s mind brings diffusion of
perceptions and notions which, while not understood at its roots, will
in return diffuse further and further and so on. This cannot happen in
the <span lang="pi"><em>arahant</em></span>’s mind any more. His
consciousness has ’ceased’ so there is nothing to follow and diversify
upon this teleological characteristic of the existential structure,
which will remain only until his aggregates ‘break apart’.</p>
