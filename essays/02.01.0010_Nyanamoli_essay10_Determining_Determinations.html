<p>1. Feeling, perception and consciousness are always there together.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It is impossible to have them
arising independently and on their own; when there is one, the other two
are present as well. They do not pass into each other’s domain<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>: one feels one’s feeling, one
perceives one’s perception, one cognizes one’s cognizance. Assuming that
it is the same thing that one feels, perceives and cognizes, or assuming
that it is a different thing that one feels, perceives, and cognizes, or
both-the-same-&amp;-different thing that one feels, perceives, and
cognizes, or neither-the-same-nor-different thing that one feels,
perceives, and cognizes, means that <em>assumed thing</em> is
<em>there-</em>it <em>exists</em>. One <em>conceives it</em> through
one’s feeling, one’s perception, and one’s cognizance. One conceives
that thing because of which feeling, perception and cognizance are
there, <em>as that thing</em> because of which feeling, perception and
cognizance are there. But since all one can ever feel is one’s feeling;
all one can ever perceive is one’s perception; all one can ever cognize
is one’s cognizance-<em>that thing</em> which is conceived <em>as
that</em> <em>because of</em> which feeling, perception and cognizance
are there, will <em>have to</em> <em>be</em> either <em>a feeling, a
perception</em> or <em>a cognizance</em>, and as such <em>cannot be that
because of which</em> feeling, perception and cognizance are there.<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> By conceiving a feeling, or a
perception, or a cognizance <em>as that because of which</em> feeling,
perception and cognizance are there, one <em>assumes</em> that feeling,
or perception, or cognizance, <em>existing</em> <em>independently</em>
of feeling, perception and cognizance, <em>as that because of which</em>
feeling, perception and cognizance are there. Thus, <em>that because of
which</em> feeling, perception and cognizance <em>are</em> there,
<em>manifests</em> <em>in that</em> feeling, perception or cognizance
which are <em>assumed [to be]{.underline} that because of which</em>
feeling, perception and cognizance are there. Thus, <em>that because of
which</em> feeling, perception and cognizance <em>are</em>
there<em>,</em> manifests in that being-it <em>exists</em>.</p>
<p>2. That because of which feeling, perception and cognizance are
there, is that which is <em>a</em> <em>necessary condition</em> for
feeling, perception and cognizance that are there, because <em>without
it</em>, that feeling, perception and cognizance would <em>not be
there</em>. As a necessary condition, that because of which feeling,
perception and cognizance are there, is thus <em>that by which</em>
feeling, perception and cognizance are <em>determined.</em> But since
through the assumption, <em>that by which</em> feeling, perception and
cognizance are <em>determined</em>, <em>manifests</em> <em>as</em>
feeling, perception, or cognizance <em>because of which</em> that
feeling, perception and cognizance are there, <em>that</em> feeling,
perception and cognizance <em>are determined [as that by
which]{.underline}</em> feeling, perception and cognizance <em>are
determined</em>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Thus, through <em>not knowing</em>
that one can only feel one’s feelings, perceive one’s perception,
cognize one’s cognizance,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> one <em>determines that by
which</em> one’s feeling, perception and cognizance are <em>determined,
as</em> a feeling, a perception or a cognizance. Through that lack of
knowledge, determinations are manifested-<em>avijjāpaccayā
saṅkārā.</em></p>
<p>3. One determines one’s determinations through assuming that because
of which determinations are there.</p>
<p>But that because of which determinations are there cannot be that
which is determined by those determinations, since all one can determine
are one’s determination, not <em>that</em> <em>because of which</em>
those determinations are there. Since determinations cannot determine
that because of which determinations are there, that because of which
determinations are there is that which is non-determinable-it is
<em>undetermined</em>. If that because of which the determinations are
there was <em>to be</em> determined, then the escape from determinations
would not be possible.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>One can know that that because of which determinations are there
cannot be determined.</p>
<p>Without knowing <em>that knowing,</em> one’s knowledge of that
because of which determinations are there, <em>determines</em> that
because of which determinations are there, <em>as that</em> because of
which determinations are there.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Since that because of which determinations are there <em>cannot
fundamentally be determined,</em> one’s knowledge that
<em>determines</em> that because of which determinations are there,
<em>leads to</em> ‘assuming’ <em>that</em> because of which
determinations are there <em>as that</em> because of which
determinations are there.</p>
<p>And since that assumption is then <em>there</em>, <em>that</em> which
is determined as <em>that</em> <em>because</em> <em>of which</em>
determinations are there, is <em>there too</em>, <em>as that
assumed</em> <em>determination</em> because of which determinations are
there-it is <em>manifested</em>, it <em>exists</em>.</p>
<p><strong>One can know that that because of which determinations are
there cannot be determined.</strong></p>
<p><strong>By knowing <em>that knowing</em>,</strong><a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>
<strong>one’s knowledge of that because of which determinations are
there, <em>does not determine</em> that because of which determinations
are there,</strong><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <strong><em>as that</em> because of
which determinations are there.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Since that because of which determinations are there
<em>cannot fundamentally be determined,</em></strong><a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
<strong>one’s knowledge that <em>does not determine</em> that because of
which determinations are there <em>does not lead to</em> ‘assuming’
<em>that</em> because of which determinations are there <em>as that</em>
because of which determinations are there.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And since that assumption is then <em>not there,</em> that
which is determined as that because of which determinations are there,
is <em>not there either</em>, <em>as that assumed</em>
<em>determination</em> because of which determinations are there-it is
<em>not manifested,</em> it <em>does not exist.</em></strong><a

<li id="fn3"><p>Now is probably the time to mention that none of this,
nor paragraphs to follow, can be grasped intellectually by the reader.
Things that are described here are not to be made sense of in a
rationally or philosophically satisfying way, but to be seen in a
certain order that they arise in one’s experience. Hence the deliberate
repetitive style which aligns things in the order they are to be
understood (which is also the reason why the Suttas are in that form).
Also, refraining from a too particular and established terminology was
intentional, since that would most likely lead a reader to assume that
he already knows what those terms refer to.<a href="#fnref3"

<li id="fn6"><p>“There is, monks, (a) non-born, non-become, non-made,
non determined. If, monks, there were not that non-born, non-become,
non-made, non-determined, an escape from (the) born, become, made,
determined would not be discernible. But, because there is (a) non-born,
non-become, non-made, non-determined escape from (the) born, become,
made, determined is discernible.”—Nibbāna Sutta, Ud. 8/3. the structure
of the experience fundamentally be appropriated, freedom from the
appropriation is possible.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>“From nibbāna, he has a percept of nibbāna; having known
nibbāna from nibbāna, he conceives nibbāna, he conceives in nibbāna, he
conceives out of nibbāna, he conceives ‘My’ nibbāna, he delights
nibbāna. Why is that? He has not fully understood it, I say.”—MN 1. Also
cf. MN 102, [237].<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>One knows that whether one intends toward, away, both or
neither, in regard to that because of which intentions are there, that
because of which intentions are there remains there, regardless of the
intention in regard to it. By understanding that it is fundamentally
inaccessible to one’s intentions, one ceases to crave towards it with
those intentions, one ceases to assume it through those intentions,
since neither intentions nor that which directly stands upon them,
namely-one’s assumption-could access it. And one knows that. [‘Ignorant
intentions’ are simply craving, which leads to ‘assumption’-taṇhapaccayā
upādāna. Cf. Ñāṇavīra Thera, op.cit., p.56, footnote f.: “Intention does
not imply craving-a hard thing to understand!”]).<a href="#fnref8"

<li id="fn9"><p>Does not “stand for it” in one’s experience, does not
“represent it”, does not “manifest it”.<a href="#fnref9"

<li id="fn10"><p>Cannot be ‘accessed’ by it.<a href="#fnref10"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>The assumption is made redundant.<a href="#fnref11"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>If one thinks “there is that because of which
intentions are there, which is inaccessible to those intentions”, that
thought ‘stands for’ that because of which intentions are there, and
through that thought one assumes access to that
inaccessible-inaccessible exists. If one knows that regardless of what a
thought or intention stand for, it can never “step outside” of its
nature-one can only think one’s thoughts (perception perceived) or
intend one’s intentions, not that because of which that
thought/intention are there-one ceases to assume that which that
intention stands for, because of which intention is there. Thus,
intention remains, while “attempts to access” fade away, since one sees
them as pointless and loses interest in them. When those “attempts” are
thoroughly subdued, ‘the assumption’ of that which was assumed
“accessible” (through those very attempts) disappears too, never to
return.<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>The only reason why assumption can be made redundant,
is because it was redundant in the first place. Not knowing that it was
redundant, makes it necessary, until it ceases to be so. And the reason
why assumption presents itself as necessary is because it assumes that
which is necessary in one’s experience, namely-the five aggregates.
Thus, the five aggregates, which are necessary in one’s experience, come
to exist, through the assuming of them as that which is necessary in
one’s experience. But since they are necessary in one’s experience,
assuming them as necessary in one’s experience is not necessary. But
until one knows that, that assumption will exist.<a href="#fnref13"
