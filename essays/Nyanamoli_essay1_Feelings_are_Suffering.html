<p>How should one free oneself from suffering?</p>
<p>The very first step that one should make is to learn how not to
<em>crave</em> the cessation of suffering. At first glance this might
seem simple, but actually it is not so straightforward at all; for we
cannot assume that an untrained, ordinary person even knows what truly
suffering is.</p>
<p>In order to know <em>dukkha</em> it is not enough just to suffer. To
know <em>dukkha</em>, one has to recognize, within the present
experience, what <em>is</em> and what <em>is not</em> necessary. The
point is that, in the experience of pain, certain aspects are
inevitable, while others, are not. In different words – the
‘painfulness’ of pain is suffering and not the pain itself.</p>
<p>Let me get back to the opening statement that one should not crave
the cessation of suffering; why is that essential? The <em>immediate
reason</em> of our suffering, as the Buddha tells us, is our craving or
<em>taṇha</em>. It is because of <em>taṇha</em> that our experience of
pain is <em>painful</em>. This applies to the other two kinds of feeling
too. Thus, we can say, that it is because of craving that
<em>feelings</em> are <em>dukkha</em>. In the first type, unpleasant
feeling, craving for the <em>cessation</em> of that feeling causes one
to suffer: the painful feeling is present there, directly opposed to
one’s desire for it to not-be, to disappear. In this way a discrepancy
is created, a discrepancy which is nothing but <em>dukkha</em>. In the
second type, pleasant feeling, craving for <em>more</em> of that feeling
is manifested, thus the <em>actual</em> pleasant feeling appears as
unpleasant, when attended from the direction of that increased pleasure
which is <em>craved for</em>. The present feeling of pleasure becomes
inadequate, a lack which needs to be satisfied. Again, the discrepancy
arises, which one tries to overcome by a further pursuit of various
things in the world which, will <em>intensify</em> his pleasure further.
One hopes that such attempt will ‘fill the gap’ within, but needless to
say, that is impossible since the discrepancy is actually being
constantly <em>generated</em> by the presence of <em>taṇha</em>, and
<em>not</em> by the various objects in the world.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Thought and lust are a man’s sensuality,<br />
Not the various things in the world;<br />
Thought and lust are a man’s sensuality,<br />
The various things just stand there in the world;<br />
But the wise get rid of desire therein.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>– AN VI 63 / iii, 411</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When it comes to third type, neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feelings
(i.e. neutral), suffering is experienced as a result of one craving
<em>for feelings</em> themselves, since neutral feeling is not
recognized at all:</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“Neutral feeling is pleasant when known [as such],<br />
and unpleasant when not-known [as such]”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>– MN 44 / i, 303</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, to summarize, one’s experience of pain is <em>not</em> the reason
for one’s suffering. It is rather the presence of craving, in one’s
experience, that suffering <em>is there</em>. As long as this remains
the case, one will be a “victim” of one’s own feelings, be they
pleasant, unpleasant or neutral.</p>
