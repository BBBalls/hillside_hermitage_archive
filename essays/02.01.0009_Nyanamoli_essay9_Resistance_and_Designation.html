<p>“‘With name-&amp;-matter as condition, contact’, so it was said: how
it is, Ānanda, that with name-&amp;-matter as condition there is contact
should be seen in this manner. Those tokens, Ānanda, those marks, those
signs, those indications by which the name-body is described,—they being
absent, would designation-contact be manifest in the matter-body?</p>
<p>-No indeed, lord.</p>

<p>1. ‘Matter’ is required for ‘name’ to be present. If there would not
be that which is ‘named’, ‘name’ would not be able to arise. If on the
other hand, ‘name’ is absent, ‘matter’ would simply be inconceivable.
Thus, there is no ‘name’ without ‘matter’ and there is no ‘matter’
without ‘name’, hence-<em>name-&amp;-matter</em>. In this way ‘name’
<em>designates</em> the resistance, and ‘matter’ <em>resists</em> the
designation. Without ‘name’(-body), there would not be any designation
manifested in ‘matter’(-body), but without ‘matter’(-body), there would
not be any resistance manifested in the ‘name’(-body). It is these
respective <em>manifestations</em> of ‘designation’ and ‘resistance’
that are <em>puthujjana’s</em> problem.</p>
<p>2. With name-&amp;-matter, he <em>assumes</em> that it is
<em>this</em> ‘matter’ that is <em>designated.</em> Through that
<em>assumption,</em> designation <em>manifests</em> in that matter
body<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. In this way one’s ‘matter’ is
<em>designated</em>-one is <em>contacted</em>.</p>
<p>With name-&amp;-matter, he <em>assumes</em> that it is <em>this</em>
‘name’ that is <em>resisted.</em> Through that <em>assumption,</em>
resistance <em>manifests</em> in that name-body. In this way one’s
‘name’ is <em>resisted</em>-one is <em>contacted</em>.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p><u>He assumes that it is *this* ‘matter’ that is designated.</u></p>
<p>He assumes it is the <em>same</em> ‘matter’ that is designated and is
the condition for ‘name’; he assumes it is a <em>different</em> ‘matter’
that is designated and is the condition for ‘name’; He assumes it is
<em>both-same-&amp;-different</em> matter that is designated and is the
condition for ‘name’; He assumes it is
<em>neither-same-nor-different</em> ‘matter’ that is designated and is
the condition for ‘name’. Either way-the assumption is
<em>there.</em></p>
<p>That which resists him he designates as the same, different,
both-same-&amp;-different, or neither same-nor-different, as that

this ‘matter’.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"

<p>3. <em>Cf. Mūḷapariyāya Sutta</em>, MN 1:</p>
<div class="pali">
<blockquote>
<p>Pathaviṃ pathavito sañjānāti; pathaviṃ pathavito saññatvā pathaviṃ
maññati, pathaviyā maññati, pathavito maññati, pathaviṃ meti maññati,
pathaviṃ abhinandati. taṃ kissa hetu? `apariññātaṃ tassā’ti vadāmi.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“From earth, he has a percept of earth; having had from earth a
percept, he conceives [that to be] earth, he conceives [that to be] in
earth, he conceives [that to be] out of earth, he conceives earth as
‘mine’, he delights earth. Why is that? He has not fully understood it,
I say…”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>What a <em>puthujjana</em> has to realise is that regardless of
<em>what</em> he perceives, it is always his <em>perception</em> that is
perceived. Whether it is ‘earth’, ‘water’, ‘fire’, ‘air’ or any other
thing that MN 1 mentions, all one will ever perceive
(<em>puthujjana</em> and <em>arahant</em> alike) is one’s own perception
of that ‘matter’.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> This is saying nothing else than
‘matter’ is and will <em>always be outside</em> of one’s reach, outside
of that which has appeared.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Perception is that which
is perceived, but perception would not be possible if there is no matter
to be perceived; on the other hand matter would be
<em>inconceivable</em> if perception was indiscernible. If one thinks
“it is because of the matter, that perception is there”, <em>that</em>
thought is <em>perceived</em>, which means that <em>that</em> which is
‘matter’ <em>in that thought</em> is also perceived. But since it is
only perception that can be perceived, that ‘matter’ which is perceived
in that thought, cannot be that ‘matter’ which cannot be perceived,
since it is perceived. In this way, <em>from</em> ‘matter’, a
<em>puthujjana</em> has a percept of ‘matter’, which he
<em>conceives</em> to be that <em>same</em> ‘matter’ because of which
there is a percept of matter. Or he conceives it to be
<em>different</em> ‘matter’ because of which there is a percept of
matter. Or he conceives it to be <em>both-same &amp;-different</em>
‘matter’ because of which there is a percept of matter. Or he conceives
it to be <em>neither-same-nor-different</em> ‘matter’ because of which
there is a percept of matter. Either way ‘matter’ is <em>conceived.</em>
He becomes responsible for the <em>manifestation</em> of the conceiving
of that ‘matter’, he “makes” that ‘matter’ <em>exist</em>.<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>
That “creation” is <em>his-</em>thus it is ‘<em>my</em>’ ‘matter’.<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> But, since that ‘my matter’ is
conceived as that ‘matter’ <em>because of which</em> there is a percept
of matter, then that percept[ion] too becomes ‘<em>my
perception</em>’.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> The same goes for one’s feelings and
intentions. They are all conceived as <em>mine</em>. Since the
<em>puthujjana’s</em> whole experience is <em>his</em>, he thinks he
<em>himself</em> <em>is</em> – the view of Self exists. <a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>4. When consciousness does not indicate any ‘me’ or ‘mine’, that
‘matter’ because of which there is a percept of matter, does not
manifest itself in that perception (or feeling, or intention)-it does
not manifest itself in ‘name’. Thus, in perception there is only
perception, i.e. in the seen there is only that which is seen,
namely-the seen (and so on for all the senses).<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
One ceases to “perceive ‘matter”’; one <em>knows</em><a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
such a thing is impossible or <em>inconceivable</em>,<a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
one simply <em>understands</em><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>: <em>there is</em>
matter, <em>there is</em> perception (or feeling, or intention),
<em>there is</em> (non-indicative) consciousness. One
<em>understands</em> – there are five”heaps”.<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
Since one understands them, one ceases to <em>assume</em> them. With the
cessation of assumption, <em>that</em> which they were <em>assumed to
be</em>, ceases-<em>bhava</em> comes to an end.</p>

<li id="fn4"><p>“It would be as wrong to say ‘a feeling is perceived’ as
it would ‘a percept is felt’ (which mix up saññā and vedanā); but it is
quite in order to say ‘a feeling, a percept, (that is, a felt thing, a
perceived thing) is cognized’, which simply means that a feeling or a
percept is present (as, indeed, they both are in all experience—see
Majjhima v,3 (M.i,293)). Strictly speaking, then, what is cognized is
nāmarūpa, whereas what is perceived (or felt) is saññā (or vedanā),
i.e. only nāma. This distinction can be shown grammatically. Vijānāti,
to cognize, is active voice in sense (taking an objective accusative):
consciousness cognizes a phenomenon (nāmarūpa); consciousness is always
consciousness of something. Sañjānāti, to perceive, (or vediyati, to
feel) is middle voice in sense (taking a cognate accusative): perception
perceives [a percept] (or feeling feels [a feeling]). Thus we should say
‘a blue thing (= a blueness), a painful thing (= a pain), is cognized’,
but ‘blue is perceived’ and ‘pain is felt’. (In the Suttas generally,
due allowance is to be made for the elasticity in the common usage of
words. But in certain passages, and also in one’s finer thinking,
stricter definition may be required.)”-Ñāṇavīra Thera, Clearing the

<li id="fn8"><p>If one is not to conceive that ‘matter’ because of which
there is a percept of matter, one would not conceive oneself as that
because of which there is a perceiver and conceiver of the world. Cf. SN
35.116: The eye… ear… nose… tongue… body… mind… is that in the world by
which one is a perceiver and conceiver of the world. Also, cf. Ñāṇavīra
Thera, op.cit. p. 298: And when shall we ‘not be that by which’? … the
Buddha tells us: it is when, for us, in the seen there shall be just the
seen, and so with the heard, the sensed, and the cognized. And when in
the seen is there just the seen? When the seen is no longer seen as
‘mine’ (etaṃ mama) or as ‘I’ (eso’ham asmi) or as ‘my self’ (eso me
attā): in brief, when there is no longer, in connexion with the senses,
the conceit ‘I am’, by which ‘I am a conceiver of the world’.<a
