The Teaching is for the one who feels. When one thinks "this is what I
feel", that is what one *thinks*, not what one *feels*. Feeling cannot
be thought, it cannot be perceived. What one perceives is one's
perception, what one feels is one's feeling.[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} Feeling and perception are simply *there*, superimposed, independent and different in nature.

**"What one feels, that one perceives."**

**Thinking that it is *the same* thing that one feels and
*simultaneously* perceives, means one *assumes* that \[same\] thing as
*independent* of that feeling and perception. That thing *is.***

**Thinking that it is *a different* thing that one feels and
*simultaneously* perceives, means one *assumes* that \[different\] thing
as *independent* of that feeling and perception. That thing *is.***

**Thinking that it is *both-the-same-and-different* thing that one feels
and *simultaneously* perceives, means one *assumes* that
\[both-the-same-and-different\] thing as *independent* of that feeling
and perception. That thing *is.***

**Thinking that it is *neither-the-same-nor-different* thing that one
feels and *simultaneously* perceives, means one *assumes* that
\[neither-the-same-nor-different\] thing as *independent* of that
feeling and perception. That thing *is.***

**Thus, through that assumption, one *identifies* that thing*.***

Whether one thinks it is the same, or different, or both or neither,
feeling is there*, regardless* of the perception in regard to it. Thus,
a feeling cannot be thought, it can only be *felt.* A perception cannot
be felt, it can only be *perceived.* One has to learn *how to feel*, or
how to *know* 'that because of which' the feeling is.[\[2\]](#n2){:#ref2} This means how to *discern* it from that which perception is. This cannot be done by separating feeling and perception and examining them individually.[\[3\]](#n3){:#ref3} So how can one do it then?-

**By *feeling* \[the feeling\]*.* By *perceiving* \[the perception\]*.*
By *cognizing* \[the cognizance\].**

**By *cognizing feeling-*[while]{.underline}-perceiving.**

**By *understanding* cognizing.**

**By *not-conceiving* perception.**

If the superimposition of these two completely independent
simultaneously present domains is understood, the assumption of *an
independent thing*,[\[4\]](#n4){:#ref4} outside of feeling
and perception ceases to be "a bridge" for the two. The 'thing' which is
being *identified* (as the same, different, both-the-same-and-different,
neither-the-same-nor-different)*,* is that "bridge" and feeling and
perception 'meet' or 'come together' because of it. That thing is
assumed *to be that* which one *feels* and
*perceives*.[\[5\]](#n5){:#ref5} In this way, feeling and
perception (and consciousness) also come to be
*identified*.[\[6\]](#n6){:#ref6} Thus, that '\[assumption
of a\] thing' which identifies the *unidentifiable* [\[7\]](#n7){:#ref7} feeling and perception makes them *manifest in* that
*identity*-feeling and perception come to *exist*. The identity feels,
the identity perceives-*I* feel, *I* perceive.

**One feels pleasure, one feels pain, one feels
neither-pain-nor-pleasure.**

**One perceives blue, one perceives yellow, one perceives red, one
perceives white.**[\[8\]](#n8){:#ref8}

One can be *aware* of what one feels; one can also be *aware* of what
one perceives. *Through understanding that because of which one is*
*aware of,* one *knows* the feeling and perception *structurally* cannot
overlap or merge or "be bridged" or identified;[\[9\]](#n9){:#ref9} This makes the *assumption* in regard to feeling and
perception (as the same, different, both-the-same-and-different,
neither-the-same-nor-different),[\[10\]](#n10){:#ref10}
*redundant*, *irrelevant*, *not worth maintaining.* Why? Because it does
not and it cannot make *any difference* to the *structural order* of
things (feeling feels, perception perceives). If it could, the freedom
from suffering would not be possible.[\[11\]](#n11){:#ref11} Fully understanding that whichever way one's thought
(assumption) goes, the feeling cannot be *identified* as (the same,
different, both-the-same-and-different, neither-the-same-nor-different
from) perception, leaves that feeling and that perception just standing
there*-indifferent* to each other.[\[12\]](#n12){:#ref12}
[\[13\]](#n13){:#ref13}

**Agreeable perception is assumed *to be* *that* which is pleasantly
felt;**

**Disagreeable perception is assumed *to be* *that* which is
unpleasantly felt;**

**Neutral perception is assumed *to be that* which is neutrally felt.**

Thus, one thinks it is *this sight* [\[14\]](#n14){:#ref14} (sounds, smells...thoughts) *that is felt*. Because of
that feeling one sets upon to 'affect' those sights (sounds, smells,
...thoughts), sets upon to change them, modify them, adjust them, pursue
them, avoid them; one gets *entangled* in the sights (sounds,
smells...thoughts) *on account* *of what* one feels *when they are* .
Knowing that feeling is *just there-*being felt, and perception is *just
there*-being perceived, makes further entanglement *impossible*, and any
entanglement that was there[\[15\]](#n15){:#ref15} is made
redundant, disowned, dropped down, never to picked up again. Why?
Because it was structurally impossible to get entangled in the first
place, but until one has fully understood that, one's
'not-knowing-that-one-cannot-be-entangled' *was one's entanglement.*
When one understands that the arisen things cannot structurally *relate*
to each other-feeling feels the feeling, perception perceives the
perception[\[16\]](#n16){:#ref16} --*concern* becomes
impossible or *inconceivable-dukkha* completely ceases, never to arise
again.

2. {:#n2} Or how to not-conceive 'that because of which' perception is. [\[back\]](#ref2)

3. {:#n3} Thinking it in isolation from the present experience (i.e. from perception and consciousness) would amount to this. Since the separation cannot actually occur (not even in one's imagination), all one can do is assume that which is different between those three. [\[back\]](#ref3)

4. {:#n4} The \[sense of\] independence is the inevitable outcome of the presence of the assumption in one's experience. It is not therefore accidental that one's sense of Self is always regarded as an extra-temporal and changeless, i.e. independent (from the rest of the experience). Cf. Ñāṇavīra Thera, op.cit., ATTĀ, §1 and L.147, §3. [\[back\]](#ref4)

5. {:#n5} Thus, because of this assumption, one feels the thing, not one's feelings; one perceives the thing, not one's perception. By doing so one conceives things different to what they are, and when those things change one suffers. [\[back\]](#ref5)

6. {:#n6} Cf. my essay Determining Determinations. 'That because of which' \[feeling, perception, consciousness are\] is assumed as 'that which' feeling, perception, consciousness 'are'. [\[back\]](#ref6)

12. {:#n12} By understanding this structural 'indifference', one feels indifferent to the whole structure-which is what upekkhā is. [\[back\]](#ref12)

13. {:#n13} It is the nature of the superimposition that breeds this indifference, since concern is in its nature always in relation to something. [\[back\]](#ref13)
