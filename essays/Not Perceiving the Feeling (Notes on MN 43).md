## Not Perceiving the Feeling (Notes on MN 43)

>**Friend, feeling and perception and consciousness-these things are
associated, not disassociated. It is not possible to separate them and
by separating them point out the difference \[between them\]. What one
feels, that one perceives. What one perceives, that one cognizes.
Therefore, these things are associated not disassociated. It is not
possible to separate them and by separating them point out the
difference\[between them\].**

>-- MN 43

The Teaching is for the one who feels. When one thinks "this is what I
feel", that is what one *thinks*, not what one *feels*. Feeling cannot
be thought, it cannot be perceived. What one perceives is one's
perception, what one feels is one's
feeling.^[Cf. Ñāṇavīra Thera, Clearing the Path, SAÑÑĀ, §2.]
Feeling and perception are simply *there*, superimposed, independent and
different in nature.

**"What one feels, that one perceives."**

**Thinking that it is *the same* thing that one feels and
*simultaneously* perceives, means one *assumes* that \[same\] thing as
*independent* of that feeling and perception. That thing *is.***

**Thinking that it is *a different* thing that one feels and
*simultaneously* perceives, means one *assumes* that \[different\] thing
as *independent* of that feeling and perception. That thing *is.***

**Thinking that it is *both-the-same-and-different* thing that one feels
and *simultaneously* perceives, means one *assumes* that
\[both-the-same-and-different\] thing as *independent* of that feeling
and perception. That thing *is.***

**Thinking that it is *neither-the-same-nor-different* thing that one
feels and *simultaneously* perceives, means one *assumes* that
\[neither-the-same-nor-different\] thing as *independent* of that
feeling and perception. That thing *is.***

**Thus, through that assumption, one *identifies* that thing*.***

Whether one thinks it is the same, or different, or both or neither,
feeling is there*, regardless* of the perception in regard to it. Thus,
a feeling cannot be thought, it can only be *felt.* A perception cannot
be felt, it can only be *perceived.* One has to learn *how to feel*, or
how to *know* 'that because of which' the feeling
is.^[Or
how to not-conceive 'that because of which' perception
is.] This
means how to *discern* it from that which perception is. This cannot be
done by separating feeling and perception and examining them
individually.^[Thinking
it in isolation from the present experience (i.e. from perception and
consciousness) would amount to this. Since the separation cannot
actually occur (not even in one's imagination), all one can do is assume
that which is different between those
three.]
So how can one do it then?-

**By *feeling* \[the feeling\]*.* By *perceiving* \[the perception\]*.*
By *cognizing* \[the cognizance\]*.***

**By *cognizing feeling-*[while]{.underline}-perceiving*.***

**By *understanding* cognizing.**

**By *not-conceiving* perception.**

If the superimposition of these two completely independent
simultaneously present domains is understood, the assumption of *an
independent
thing*,^[The
\[sense of\] independence is the inevitable outcome of the presence of
the assumption in one's experience. It is not therefore accidental that
one's sense of Self is always regarded as an extra-temporal and
changeless, i.e. independent (from the rest of the experience). Cf.
Ñāṇavīra Thera, op.cit., ATTĀ, §1 and L.147,
§3.]
outside of feeling and perception ceases to be "a bridge" for the two.
The 'thing' which is being *identified* (as the same, different,
both-the-same-and-different, neither-the-same-nor-different)*,* is that
"bridge" and feeling and perception 'meet' or 'come together' because of
it. That thing is assumed *to be that* which one *feels* and
*perceives*.^[Thus,
because of this assumption, one feels the thing, not one's feelings; one
perceives the thing, not one's perception. By doing so one conceives
things different to what they are, and when those things change one
suffers.]
In this way, feeling and perception (and consciousness) also come to be
*identified*.^[Cf.
my essay Determining Determinations. 'That because of which' \[feeling,
perception, consciousness are\] is assumed as 'that which' feeling,
perception, consciousness 'are'.] Thus, that '\[assumption of a\] thing'
which identifies the *unidentifiable
^["It
is not possible to separate them and by separating them point out the
difference..."-MN 43.] *feeling and perception makes them *manifest in*
that *identity*-feeling and perception come to *exist*. The identity
feels, the identity perceives-*I* feel, *I* perceive.

**One feels pleasure, one feels pain, one feels
neither-pain-nor-pleasure.**

**One perceives blue, one perceives yellow, one perceives red, one
perceives
white.**^[Cf.
MN 43.]

One can be *aware* of what one feels; one can also be *aware* of what
one perceives. *Through understanding that because of which one is*
*aware of,* one *knows* the feeling and perception *structurally* cannot
overlap or merge or "be bridged" or
identified*;^[Or
cross into each other's domains.]* This makes the *assumption* in regard to
feeling and perception (as the same, different,
both-the-same-and-different,
neither-the-same-nor-different),^[All
of these are forms of identity.] *redundant*, *irrelevant*, *not worth
maintaining.* Why? Because it does not and it cannot make *any
difference* to the *structural order* of things (feeling feels,
perception perceives). If it could, the freedom from suffering would not
be
possible.^[Cf.
my essay .] Fully understanding that whichever way one's
thought (assumption) goes, the feeling cannot be *identified* as (the
same, different, both-the-same-and-different,
neither-the-same-nor-different from) perception, leaves that feeling and
that perception just standing there*-indifferent* to each
other.^[By
understanding this structural 'indifference', one feels indifferent to
the whole structure-which is what upekkhā
is.]
^[It
is the nature of the superimposition that breeds this indifference,
since concern is in its nature always in relation to
something.]

**Agreeable perception is assumed *to be* *that* which is pleasantly
felt;**

**Disagreeable perception is assumed *to be* *that* which is
unpleasantly felt;**

**Neutral perception is assumed *to be that* which is neutrally felt.**

Thus, one thinks it is *this sight*
^[Disagreeable
(or agreeable, or neutral)](sounds, smells...thoughts) *that is felt*. Because
of that feeling one sets upon to 'affect' those sights (sounds, smells,
...thoughts), sets upon to change them, modify them, adjust them, pursue
them, avoid them; one gets *entangled* in the sights (sounds,
smells...thoughts) *on account* *of what* one feels *when they are* .
Knowing that feeling is *just there-*being felt, and perception is *just
there*-being perceived, makes further entanglement *impossible*, and any
entanglement that was
there^[In
the past, or possible in the future, or standing there in the
present.] is made redundant, disowned, dropped down, never
to picked up again. Why? Because it was structurally impossible to get
entangled in the first place, but until one has fully understood that,
one's 'not-knowing-that-one-cannot-be-entangled' *was one's
entanglement.* When one understands that the arisen things cannot
structurally *relate* to each other-feeling feels the feeling,
perception perceives the
perception^[Matter
matters, feeling feels, perception perceives, determinations determine,
consciousness cognizes.] --*concern* becomes impossible or
*inconceivable-dukkha* completely ceases, never to arise again.
