<p>The Right meditation is inseparable from the Right view. That means
that even if a person doesn’t have the Right view, their meditation
should be concerned about getting it. To put it simply – it comes down
to developing the self-transparency (or self-honesty) concerning skilful
as skilful (<em>kusala</em>) and unskilful as unskilful
(<em>akusala</em>). The Buddha defined the Right view in those very
terms – knowing “good as good”, and “bad as bad”. The person with the
Right view knows for oneself, beyond any doubt, <em>kusala</em> as
<em>kusala</em> and <em>akusala</em> as <em>akusala</em>. By seeing it –
he recognizes it. He doesn’t need to hold or adopt any other external
criteria. The clarity of his vision pertains to here and now,
internally. Thus, for someone who hasn’t achieved that yet, that’s where
the meditation should start. Obtaining of the Right criteria and then
meditating through it. Keeping it “composed” is the definition of the
Right <em>samadhi</em>.</p>
<p>The problem is that this kind of instruction is very non-specific.
People today usually need something more proliferated and palpable. They
require meditation “methods”. An average man today wants a “recipe”, a
prescription of “steps”. He needs to know what <em>exactly</em> he
should <em>do</em>, that would then automatically result in his
liberation. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work like that. If we look at the
Suttas, whenever the Buddha was talking about meditation it was to bring
the fulfilment of knowledge and wisdom. Yet, if a person has none of the
latter to begin with, then the fulfilment cannot arise nor be fabricated
mechanically. Very often the Buddha’s reply on how to meditate would be
in instructing people in recognizing and avoiding the unskilful, and
cultivating (<em>bhavana</em>) of the skilful. Discerning the nature of
<em>kusala</em> and <em>akusala</em> has the potential of taking the
mind above both. Freeing it from action (<em>kamma</em>) and it’s
results (<em>vipaka</em>), since they are bound to the domain of skilful
and unskilful. And that’s exactly why performing (<em>doing</em> or
<em>acting</em>) of the specific steps, cannot take one beyond the
nature of <em>kamma</em>. Understanding it however, might.</p>
<p>Furthermore, methods and techniques usually don’t amount to more than
management of the problem of suffering. Management of something cannot
actually uproot that very thing. So, instead of that, a person will be
better of in trying to discern what kind of attitude towards meditation
can be sustained throughout the day. An attitude that wouldn’t need any
particular favorable environment or special conditions to be applied in.
Regardless of whether one is sitting in a full lotus posture, or just
walking down the street. One needs to find that kind of
<em>composure</em> that one can maintain in both circumstances. The way
to do this is if the composure is established upon the <em>general
mindfulness</em>. Not the particular observation and adherence to the
prescribed steps of a “meditation” technique, that results in one being
<em>absorbed</em> in it. Absorption is the opposite of general
mindfulness.</p>
<p>Every <em>jhana</em> for example is fully founded upon the basis of
the unshakeable mindfulness as number of Suttas often mention. So, even
if a person wants to do his meditation in a “formal” manner, such as sit
for an hour few times a day, that is fine. As long as it is not done for
the purpose of developing some sort of “experience of absoption” out of
it. Like trying to watch one’s breath hoping for some novelty energy
release. The point of meditation is to remain <em>present</em> as much
as possible. Present or mindful of <em>whatever</em> is <strong>already
there</strong> (feelings, perceptions, intentions). Not interfere with
it, or deny it, or try to replace it. Just discerning the enduring
presence of the arisen experience. Emotionally, perceptually and
intentionally. That kind of composure can then be “spread out” over
one’s entire day, even when a person is not sitting down to
meditate.</p>
<p>And this should not be too hard to grasp (though that doesn’t mean it
will be easy to accept). The whole point of the practice of Dhamma and
meditation is nothing other than understanding of the nature of things.
The understanding that arises on account of mindful discerning of
whatever is <em>arisen</em> and <em>enduring</em> in our experience. And
it’s that understanding of the unskilful that frees the mind from it. If
a person wants to be truly free once and for all, the only way to do so
is through the knowledge and mindfulness.</p>
<p>Thus, if one wants to practice in a manner that pertains to this
final goal of freedom, he needs to become very mindful and honest about
intentionality behind any actions. Simple actions, more complex ones,
careless or important, big or small – actions of any kind done by body,
speech or mind. One will need to attend to them mindfully until the
motivation and intentions behind is fully seen. That is because it is
the intention that defines wholesome action as wholesome and unwholesome
as unwholesome. The “reason” for one’s action so to speak. That’s where
skilfulness of an action is rooted at. That’s also the <em>real</em>
“reason”, the one deep inside that one might not be willing to admit to
oneself. If a person is able to reach the full transparency of one’s
intentional actions and its roots, that person is a step closer in
discerning what makes <em>kusala</em> as <em>kusala</em> and
<em>akusala</em> as <em>akusala</em>. That person is a step closer to
the beginning of the Right criteria or view.</p>
<p>So, if one needs to meditate, one needs to be concerned with one’s
actions and choices. (Which is also why <em>sila</em> or virtue comes
before the Dhamma). In such manner any motivation for one’s intentions
behind doing this or that will reveal and not taken at its face value.
Through this persistent self-questioning one can also see whether an
action that is about to be, is rooted in an unskilful motive. Like
sensuality, ill will, vanity or distraction for example. Furthermore,
one would need to abandon only <em>that</em>. The unwholesome. One
doesn’t need to cancel the entire arisen experience and behaviour. That
would be a form of overdoing it, and not using mindfulness as a criteria
of discernment. “Is what I am about to do rooted in greed? Lust? How
about ill-will and annoyance or anger?” Or “am I acting out of a desire
for distraction and forgetfulness? Am I willingly giving in to acts and
desires that would delude me further and mask the unskilful basis of
those very actions?” Such questioning about the personal and inner
dimension of one’s daily experiences and actions will <em>have to</em>
result in being mindful. This is a definition of (proper) vipassana or
investigation, since that’s exactly what’s being done. Self
investigating the motivation behind any actions. And it is obvious to
see how this kind of attitude and mindful practice would result in
discerning “good as good, bad as bad”. How it would not be dependent on
any external authority or belief. Instead be a direct, visible,
universal criteria seen personally for oneself.</p>
<p>It’s important to note it is not necessary that one becomes neurotic
or obsessed (though it might happen) about it. Always having to
<em>actually</em> ask oneself “what am I doing?” before every action.
What’s important is the <em>attitude</em> of such <em>questioning</em>.
The “answer” is already implied within it. One already <em>knows</em>
why one is acting. Whether one is aware of it or not, that’s a different
matter. Of course, until that attitude is developed and refined, a
person will have to endure possible loss of (superficial) confidence and
choice paralysis. That’s because the implications of one’s smallest
actions are becoming more revealed. A person starts to feel responsible
even for things that are not in his control.</p>
<p>So through this kind of “revealing” of the roots of one’s actions,
one is simultaneously becoming less and less able to ignore one’s true
intentions. One will not be able to turn a blind eye towards acting good
while the real motivation underneath it isn’t necessarily so. That’s why
this attitude is “self-transparent”. Whatever is on the surface, one
simultaneously sees beneath it <em>as well</em>.</p>
<p>Consequently, one will be able to also see if something is genuinely
not rooted in greed, aversion or delusion. In such case even if the
whole world comes to tell him that that’s still “bad”, his discernment
would remain unshaken. As mentioned above, that’s because good and bad
are defined by the intention behind them. Not by the common tradition,
views and opinions, duty and culture, but by whether greed, aversion and
delusion underlies them.</p>
<p>It should be clear by now that the self-honesty or transparency is
not an optional thing (or just one of different ways leading to the same
goal). It’s an absolute pre-requisite for any chance of getting the
Right view and knowing how to practice the Dhamma. If a person still has
difficulties in abandoning own dependence upon a particular “method” of
practice, they can still take up this practice of self-questioning all
the time, as a “method”. Although not ideal, it will still result in
seeing through the motivation and emotional need for any methods in the
first place. (Needing “something to do”.) By seeing the subtle
motivation under <em>any</em> action, one will automatically feel
responsible for one’s choices. No matter how “justified” those might
seem externally. The weight on it is always on oneself, and that’s
something that one cannot ignore any further.</p>
<p>It is also then when the full weight of the Buddha’s “beings are
owners of one’s actions” saying, is truly felt.</p>
