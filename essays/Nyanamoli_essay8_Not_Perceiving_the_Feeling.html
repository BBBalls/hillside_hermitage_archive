<p>Friend, feeling and perception and consciousness-these things are
associated, not disassociated. It is not possible to separate them and
by separating them point out the difference [between them]. What one
feels, that one perceives. What one perceives, that one cognizes.
Therefore, these things are associated not disassociated. It is not

<p>The Teaching is for the one who feels. When one thinks “this is what
I feel”, that is what one <em>thinks</em>, not what one <em>feels</em>.
Feeling cannot be thought, it cannot be perceived. What one perceives is
one’s perception, what one feels is one’s feeling.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Feeling and perception are simply <em>there</em>, superimposed,
independent and different in nature.</p>
<p><strong>“What one feels, that one perceives.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thinking that it is <em>the same</em> thing that one feels
and <em>simultaneously</em> perceives, means one <em>assumes</em> that
[same] thing as <em>independent</em> of that feeling and perception.
That thing <em>is.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Thinking that it is <em>a different</em> thing that one feels
and <em>simultaneously</em> perceives, means one <em>assumes</em> that
[different] thing as <em>independent</em> of that feeling and
perception. That thing <em>is.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Thinking that it is <em>both-the-same-and-different</em>
thing that one feels and <em>simultaneously</em> perceives, means one
<em>assumes</em> that [both-the-same-and-different] thing as
<em>independent</em> of that feeling and perception. That thing
<em>is.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Thinking that it is <em>neither-the-same-nor-different</em>
thing that one feels and <em>simultaneously</em> perceives, means one
<em>assumes</em> that [neither-the-same-nor-different] thing as
<em>independent</em> of that feeling and perception. That thing
<em>is.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Thus, through that assumption, one <em>identifies</em> that
thing<em>.</em></strong></p>
<p>Whether one thinks it is the same, or different, or both or neither,
feeling is there<em>, regardless</em> of the perception in regard to it.
Thus, a feeling cannot be thought, it can only be <em>felt.</em> A
perception cannot be felt, it can only be <em>perceived.</em> One has to
learn <em>how to feel</em>, or how to <em>know</em> ‘that because of
which’ the feeling is.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> This means how to <em>discern</em>
it from that which perception is. This cannot be done by separating
feeling and perception and examining them individually.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> So
how can one do it then?-</p>
<p><strong>By <em>feeling</em> [the feeling]<em>.</em> By
<em>perceiving</em> [the perception]<em>.</em> By <em>cognizing</em>
[the cognizance].</strong></p>
<p><strong>By <em>cognizing
feeling-</em>[while]{.underline}-perceiving.</strong></p>
<p><strong>By <em>understanding</em> cognizing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>By <em>not-conceiving</em> perception.</strong></p>
<p>If the superimposition of these two completely independent
simultaneously present domains is understood, the assumption of <em>an
independent thing</em>,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> outside of feeling and perception
ceases to be “a bridge” for the two. The ‘thing’ which is being
<em>identified</em> (as the same, different,
both-the-same-and-different, neither-the-same-nor-different)<em>,</em>
is that “bridge” and feeling and perception ‘meet’ or ‘come together’
because of it. That thing is assumed <em>to be that</em> which one
<em>feels</em> and <em>perceives</em>.<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> In
this way, feeling and perception (and consciousness) also come to be
<em>identified</em>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Thus, that ‘[assumption of a] thing’
which identifies the <em>unidentifiable</em> <a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
feeling and perception makes them <em>manifest in</em> that
<em>identity</em>-feeling and perception come to <em>exist</em>. The
identity feels, the identity perceives-<em>I</em> feel, <em>I</em>
perceive.</p>
<p><strong>One feels pleasure, one feels pain, one feels
neither-pain-nor-pleasure.</strong></p>
<p><strong>One perceives blue, one perceives yellow, one perceives red,
one perceives white.</strong><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>One can be <em>aware</em> of what one feels; one can also be
<em>aware</em> of what one perceives. <em>Through understanding that
because of which one is</em> <em>aware of,</em> one <em>knows</em> the
feeling and perception <em>structurally</em> cannot overlap or merge or
“be bridged” or identified;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> This makes the
<em>assumption</em> in regard to feeling and perception (as the same,
different, both-the-same-and-different,
neither-the-same-nor-different),<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <em>redundant</em>,
<em>irrelevant</em>, <em>not worth maintaining.</em> Why? Because it
does not and it cannot make <em>any difference</em> to the
<em>structural order</em> of things (feeling feels, perception
perceives). If it could, the freedom from suffering would not be
possible.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Fully understanding that whichever
way one’s thought (assumption) goes, the feeling cannot be
<em>identified</em> as (the same, different,
both-the-same-and-different, neither-the-same-nor-different from)
perception, leaves that feeling and that perception just standing there
– <em>indifferent</em> to each other.<a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Agreeable perception is assumed <em>to be</em> <em>that</em>
which is pleasantly felt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disagreeable perception is assumed <em>to be</em>
<em>that</em> which is unpleasantly felt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neutral perception is assumed <em>to be that</em> which is
neutrally felt.</strong></p>
<p>Thus, one thinks it is <em>this sight</em> <a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
(sounds, smells…thoughts) <em>that is felt</em>. Because of that feeling
one sets upon to ‘affect’ those sights (sounds, smells, …thoughts), sets
upon to change them, modify them, adjust them, pursue them, avoid them;
one gets <em>entangled</em> in the sights (sounds, smells…thoughts)
<em>on account</em> <em>of what</em> one feels <em>when they are</em> .
Knowing that feeling is <em>just there-</em>being felt, and perception
is <em>just there</em>-being perceived, makes further entanglement
<em>impossible</em>, and any entanglement that was there<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>
is made redundant, disowned, dropped down, never to picked up again.
Why? Because it was structurally impossible to get entangled in the
first place, but until one has fully understood that, one’s
‘not-knowing-that-one-cannot-be-entangled’ <em>was one’s
entanglement.</em> When one understands that the arisen things cannot
structurally <em>relate</em> to each other-feeling feels the feeling,
perception perceives the perception<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> –<em>concern</em>
becomes impossible or <em>inconceivable-dukkha</em> completely ceases,
never to arise again.</p>

<li id="fn3"><p>Thinking it in isolation from the present experience
(i.e. from perception and consciousness) would amount to this. Since the

<li id="fn4"><p>The [sense of] independence is the inevitable outcome of
the presence of the assumption in one’s experience. It is not therefore
accidental that one’s sense of Self is always regarded as an
extra-temporal and changeless, i.e. independent (from the rest of the
experience). Cf. Ñāṇavīra Thera, op.cit., ATTĀ, §1 and L.147, §3.<a

<li id="fn5"><p>Thus, because of this assumption, one feels the thing,
not one’s feelings; one perceives the thing, not one’s perception. By
