<p>By making peace with what is felt, one is developing <span
lang="pi"><em>metta</em></span> or non-ill will. By that I mean, no
longer interfering with what is felt, by no longer trying to change it,
but by withstanding it, by not craving it, by fully comprehending
it.</p>
<p>When you feel pleasure, your default mode is to try and keep it, you
want it to stay, you try to increase it because it does not feel
adequate, there is something about it that just isn’t satisfying you,
yet it is ‘pleasure’, it is already enough of what it is in itself. In
other words, pleasure is not good enough for you, you crave for it to be
more, to last longer, and so on.</p>
<p>Your delighting in pleasure will not make you content, because it’s
an agitated attempt to keep pleasure, it’s a holding on to something
which is not yours and impossible to make your own. Such an act is not
only lustful but also aversive and ignorant, an act of wanting things to
be the way you want them to be and not the way they are.</p>
<p>When you feel pain, your default mode is to try to get rid of it, to
decrease it. Yet it is the way it is and your attempt to change it is
again not peaceful, it’s not kind, not compassionate, not content, not
equanimous. You don’t want pain so you seek pleasure but when you get
it, still you are not satisfied. After all, it can never be yours. Your
gratuitous attitude of craving can never be satisfied no matter what you
put in front of it. Its nature is to be unfulfilled.</p>
<p>You want the pain to change and you want pleasure not to change. You
want <span lang="pi"><em>anicca</em></span> and you don’t want <span
lang="pi"><em>anicca</em></span>. Wanting <span
lang="pi"><em>anicca</em></span> is wanting <span
lang="pi"><em>dukkha</em></span>. This wanting or interfering with
feeling which changes is maintaining your liability to be affected by
feeling, which means you will never be peaceful, your mind will be
dragged around with feeling in whichever way it goes. This wanting and
touching feeling means that you will always be affected by it. In other
words, you love when it’s pleasant and hate when it’s unpleasant. You
are on and will continue to be on an emotional rollercoaster because you
take feelings personally, you are holding them.</p>
<p>By detaching from a feeling through understanding its nature, and by
no longer touching it with your attitude of wanting/craving, by way of
not acting out of intentions based on greed, hate, or delusion, the
feeling will not affect you anymore, you will be unable to love and
therefore unable to hate. Your mental state will be brought to
equilibrium, peace, and <span lang="pi"><em>upekkha</em></span>.</p>
<p>The reason I am emphasizing having the attitude of <span
lang="pi"><em>metta</em></span> towards what is felt is because it’s a
refined act of non-craving, which if sustained, will eventually result
in there being no possibility of hating anyone, because the only reason
you find another person or situation irritating to the point of hatred,
is because you hate the pain that has arisen and you long for the
pleasure that is forever out of your control.</p>
<p><u><strong>Love or non-hate.</strong></u></p>
<p>The problem that you can encounter if you think the <span
lang="pi"><em>metta</em></span> practice taught in the suttas by the
Buddha, is the practice of love, is that you will continue to delight in
pleasure dependent on the senses, which means you will also hate or be
irritated when there is not enough of it. The degree to which you love
is the degree to which you can hate.</p>
<p><span lang="pi"><em>Metta</em></span> is not about love but non-hate.
It’s a quality that a great friend has. They can never hate you because
they cannot love you. They are not emotionally dependent on feelings,
their minds are undisturbed, peaceful, and therefore can be of great
benefit to another who is clouded by love and hate or affected by
feelings. No matter what you do, they see clearly when you do not. Their
benevolence, their <span lang="pi"><em>metta</em></span> is
“unconditioned”.</p>
<p><span lang="pi"><em>Metta</em></span> when fully developed becomes
<span lang="pi"><em>upekkha</em></span>, complete peaceful detachment,
and that cannot come about when you are doing something which is not
peaceful, like fighting or even delighting in pleasure desperately
holding on to it so that it doesn’t change. That is not the path of
peace or renunciation.</p>
<p>Renunciation of pleasure means not interfering with it, renunciation
of pain means not interfering with it. Renunciation means
non-craving.</p>
<p>When there is pain practice <span lang="pi"><em>metta</em></span>
towards that. When there is pleasure, practice <span
lang="pi"><em>metta</em></span> towards that, not wanting it to stay or
change, i.e. unconditional friendliness.</p>
<p>If you want to practice <span lang="pi"><em>metta</em></span> for the
uprooting of the cause of suffering, then you must let go of the
feeling, let it be what it is, patiently withstand it, without
interfering, and then you will be in a good position to see its nature,
which is <em>agitating</em>. All feeling agitates and by holding on to
it, by touching it, you are agitated, sometimes a lot as with pain or
only a little as with pleasure, either way, feeling is an agitation. You
can then realize that there is no such thing as pleasure, there are only
different degrees of pain, and all this time, what you thought was
pleasure was just less pain, and due to that assumption you held on to
it as yours, as yourself, and thus were affected by its agitated
nature.</p>
<p>The more you let go of your craving regarding a feeling the less it
will affect you and the more peaceful/<span
lang="pi"><em>upekkha</em></span> you become. This means that no matter
what happens in life, no matter how much pain is ‘caused to you by
another being’, you will be peaceful, and you will not be able to get
angry, hateful, or irritated. Your mind will be a <span
lang="pi"><em>brahmavihara</em></span>/a heavenly place because you
removed the cause of love and hate from it.</p>
