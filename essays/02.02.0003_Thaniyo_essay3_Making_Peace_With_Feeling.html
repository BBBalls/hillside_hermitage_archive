<p>By making peace with what is felt, one is developing <em>metta</em>
or non-ill will. By that I mean, no longer interfering with what is
felt, by no longer trying to change it, but by withstanding it, by not
craving it, by fully comprehending it.</p>
<p>When you feel pleasure, your default mode is to try and keep it, you
want it to stay, you try to increase it because it does not feel
adequate, there is something about it that just isn’t satisfying you,
yet it is ‘pleasure’, it is already enough of what it is in itself. In
other words, pleasure is not good enough for you, you crave for it to be
more, to last longer, and so on.</p>
<p>Your delighting in pleasure will not make you content, because it’s
an agitated attempt to keep pleasure, it’s a holding on to something
which is not yours and impossible to make your own. Such an act is not
only lustful but also aversive and ignorant, an act of wanting things to
be the way you want them to be and not the way they are.</p>
<p>When you feel pain, your default mode is to try to get rid of it, to
decrease it. Yet it is the way it is and your attempt to change it is
again not peaceful, it’s not kind, not compassionate, not content, not
equanimous. You don’t want pain so you seek pleasure but when you get
it, still you are not satisfied. After all, it can never be yours. Your
gratuitous attitude of craving can never be satisfied no matter what you
put in front of it. Its nature is to be unfulfilled.</p>
<p>You want the pain to change and you want pleasure not to change. You
want <em>anicca</em> and you don’t want <em>anicca</em>. Wanting
<em>anicca</em> is wanting <em>dukkha</em>. This wanting or interfering
with feeling which changes is maintaining your liability to be affected
by feeling, which means you will never be peaceful, your mind will be
dragged around with feeling in whichever way it goes. This wanting and
touching feeling means that you will always be affected by it. In other
words, you love when it’s pleasant and hate when it’s unpleasant. You
are on and will continue to be on an emotional rollercoaster because you
take feelings personally, you are holding them.</p>
<p>By detaching from a feeling through understanding its nature, and by
no longer touching it with your attitude of wanting/craving, by way of
not acting out of intentions based on greed, hate, or delusion, the
feeling will not affect you anymore, you will be unable to love and
therefore unable to hate. Your mental state will be brought to
equilibrium, peace, and <em>upekkha</em>.</p>
<p>The reason I am emphasizing having the attitude of <em>metta</em>
towards what is felt is because it’s a refined act of non-craving, which
if sustained, will eventually result in there being no possibility of
hating anyone, because the only reason you find another person or
situation irritating to the point of hatred, is because you hate the
pain that has arisen and you long for the pleasure that is forever out
of your control.</p>
<p><u><strong>Love or non-hate.</strong></u></p>
<p>The problem that you can encounter if you think the <em>metta</em>
practice taught in the suttas by the Buddha, is the practice of love, is
that you will continue to delight in pleasure dependent on the senses,
which means you will also hate or be irritated when there is not enough
of it. The degree to which you love is the degree to which you can
hate.</p>
<p><em>Metta</em> is not about love but non-hate. It’s a quality that a
great friend has. They can never hate you because they cannot love you.
They are not emotionally dependent on feelings, their minds are
undisturbed, peaceful, and therefore can be of great benefit to another
who is clouded by love and hate or affected by feelings. No matter what
you do, they see clearly when you do not. Their benevolence, their
<em>metta</em> is “unconditioned”.</p>
<p><em>Metta</em> when fully developed becomes <em>upekkha</em>,
complete peaceful detachment, and that cannot come about when you are
doing something which is not peaceful, like fighting or even delighting
in pleasure desperately holding on to it so that it doesn’t change. That
is not the path of peace or renunciation.</p>
<p>Renunciation of pleasure means not interfering with it, renunciation
of pain means not interfering with it. Renunciation means
non-craving.</p>
<p>When there is pain practice <em>metta</em> towards that. When there
is pleasure, practice <em>metta</em> towards that, not wanting it to
stay or change, i.e. unconditional friendliness.</p>
<p>If you want to practice <em>metta</em> for the uprooting of the cause
of suffering, then you must let go of the feeling, let it be what it is,
patiently withstand it, without interfering, and then you will be in a
good position to see its nature, which is <em>agitating</em>. All
feeling agitates and by holding on to it, by touching it, you are
agitated, sometimes a lot as with pain or only a little as with
pleasure, either way, feeling is an agitation. You can then realize that
there is no such thing as pleasure, there are only different degrees of
pain, and all this time, what you thought was pleasure was just less
pain, and due to that assumption you held on to it as yours, as
yourself, and thus were affected by its agitated nature.</p>
<p>The more you let go of your craving regarding a feeling the less it
will affect you and the more peaceful/<em>upekkha</em> you become. This
means that no matter what happens in life, no matter how much pain is
‘caused to you by another being’, you will be peaceful, and you will not
be able to get angry, hateful, or irritated. Your mind will be a
<em>brahmavihara</em>/a heavenly place because you removed the cause of
love and hate from it.</p>
