1\. 'Matter' is required for 'name' to be present. If there would not be
that which is 'named', 'name' would not be able to arise. If on the
other hand, 'name' is absent, 'matter' would simply be inconceivable.
Thus, there is no 'name' without 'matter' and there is no 'matter'
without 'name', hence-*name-&-matter*. In this way 'name' *designates*
the resistance, and 'matter' *resists* the designation. Without
'name\'(-body), there would not be any designation manifested in
'matter\'(-body), but without 'matter\'(-body), there would not be any
resistance manifested in the 'name\'(-body). It is these respective
*manifestations* of 'designation' and 'resistance' that are
*puthujjana's* problem.

2\. With name-&-matter, he *assumes* that it is *this* 'matter' that is
*designated.* Through that *assumption,* designation *manifests* in that
matter body[^1]. In this way one's
'matter' is *designated*-one is *contacted*.

With name-&-matter, he *assumes* that it is *this* 'name' that is
*resisted.* Through that *assumption,* resistance *manifests* in that
name-body. In this way one's 'name' is *resisted*-one is *contacted*.

3\. *Cf. Mūḷapariyāya Sutta*, MN 1:

> *Pathaviṃ pathavito sañjānāti; pathaviṃ pathavito saññatvā pathaviṃ
> maññati, pathaviyā maññati, pathavito maññati, pathaviṃ meti maññati,
> pathaviṃ abhinandati. taṃ kissa hetu? \`apariññātaṃ tassā'ti vadāmi.*

> "From earth, he has a percept of earth; having had from earth a
> percept, he conceives \[that to be\] earth, he conceives \[that to
> be\] in earth, he conceives \[that to be\] out of earth, he conceives
> earth as 'mine', he delights earth. Why is that? He has not fully
> understood it, I say..."

What a *puthujjana* has to realise is that regardless of *what* he
perceives, it is always his *perception* that is perceived. Whether it
is 'earth', 'water', 'fire', 'air' or any other thing that MN 1
mentions, all one will ever perceive (*puthujjana* and *arahant* alike)
is one's own perception of that 'matter'.[^4] This is saying nothing else than 'matter' is and will
*always be outside* of one's reach, outside of that which has
appeared.[^5] Perception is that which is
perceived, but perception would not be possible if there is no matter to
be perceived; on the other hand matter would be *inconceivable* if
perception was indiscernible. If one thinks "it is because of the
matter, that perception is there", *that* thought is *perceived*, which
means that *that* which is 'matter' *in that thought* is also perceived.
But since it is only perception that can be perceived, that 'matter'
which is perceived in that thought, cannot be that 'matter' which cannot
be perceived, since it is perceived. In this way, *from* 'matter', a
*puthujjana* has a percept of 'matter', which he *conceives* to be that
*same* 'matter' because of which there is a percept of matter. Or he
conceives it to be *different* 'matter' because of which there is a
percept of matter. Or he conceives it to be *both-same &-different*
'matter' because of which there is a percept of matter. Or he conceives
it to be *neither-same-nor-different* 'matter' because of which there is
a percept of matter. Either way 'matter' is *conceived.* He becomes
responsible for the *manifestation* of the conceiving of that 'matter',
he "makes" that 'matter' *exist*.[^6] That
"creation" is *his-*thus it is '*my*' 'matter'.[^7] But, since that 'my matter' is conceived as that 'matter'
*because of which* there is a percept of matter, then that
percept\[ion\] too becomes '*my perception*'.[^8] The same goes for one's feelings and intentions. They
are all conceived as *mine*. Since the *puthujjana's* whole experience
is *his*, he thinks he *himself* *is-*the view of Self
exists.[^9]

4\. When consciousness does not indicate any 'me' or 'mine', that
'matter' because of which there is a percept of matter, does not
manifest itself in that perception (or feeling, or intention)-it does
not manifest itself in 'name'. Thus, in perception there is only
perception, i.e. in the seen there is only that which is seen,
namely-the seen (and so on for all the senses).[^10] One ceases to "perceive 'matter"'; one *knows*[^11] such a thing is impossible
or *inconceivable*,[^12] one simply *understands*[^13]: *there is* matter,
*there is* perception (or feeling, or intention), *there is*
(non-indicative) consciousness. One *understands-*there are five "heaps".[^14] Since one understands them, one ceases to *assume* them. With the cessation of assumption, *that* which they were *assumed to be*, ceases-*bhava* comes to an end.

[^1]: Upādānapaccayā bhavo.

[^2]: 'Name' assumes existence in 'matter'-'name' exists.

[^3]: 'Matter' finds footing in 'name'-'matter' exists.Cf. DN 11.

[^4]: "It would be as wrong to say 'a feeling is perceived' as it would 'a percept is felt' (which mix up saññā and vedanā); but it is quite in order to say 'a feeling, a percept, (that is, a felt thing, a perceived thing) is cognized', which simply means that a feeling or a percept is present (as, indeed, they both are in all experience---see Majjhima v,3 (M.i,293)). Strictly speaking, then, what is cognized is nāmarūpa, whereas what is perceived (or felt) is saññā (or vedanā), i.e. only nāma. This distinction can be shown grammatically. Vijānāti, to cognize, is active voice in sense (taking an objective accusative): consciousness cognizes a phenomenon (nāmarūpa); consciousness is always consciousness of something. Sañjānāti, to perceive, (or vediyati, to feel) is middle voice in sense (taking a cognate accusative): perception perceives \[a percept\] (or feeling feels \[a feeling\]). Thus we should say 'a blue thing (= a blueness), a painful thing (= a pain), is cognized', but 'blue is perceived' and 'pain is felt'. (In the Suttas generally, due allowance is to be made for the elasticity in the common usage of words. But in certain passages, and also in one's finer thinking, stricter definition may be required.)"-Ñāṇavīra Thera, Clearing the Path, 2010, p. 92.

[^5]: Cf. Ñāṇavīra Thera, Seeking The Path, 2010, p. 40, §§17-18: "\[Four mahābhutā\]...will always be just below our feet."

[^6]: Thus, 'matter' can never be perceived, but it can "find footing" in that which is perceived (or felt, or intended).

[^7]: He delights in his own creation, because it is his own creation.

[^8]: If one is not to conceive that 'matter' because of which there is a percept of matter, one would not conceive oneself as that because of which there is a perceiver and conceiver of the world. Cf. SN 35.116: The eye... ear... nose... tongue... body... mind... is that in the world by which one is a perceiver and conceiver of the world. Also, cf. Ñāṇavīra Thera, op.cit. p. 298: And when shall we 'not be that by which'? ... the Buddha tells us: it is when, for us, in the seen there shall be just the seen, and so with the heard, the sensed, and the cognized. And when in the seen is there just the seen? When the seen is no longer seen as 'mine' (etaṃ mama) or as 'I' (eso'ham asmi) or as 'my self' (eso me attā): in brief, when there is no longer, in connexion with the senses, the conceit 'I am', by which 'I am a conceiver of the world'.

[^9]: That's how the sense of the 'mine' leads to the sense of 'Self'.

[^10]: Cf. Bāhiya Sutta, Ud. 10/8.

[^11]: "Wisdom is to be developed..."-MN 43.

[^12]: If it were fundamentally subject to one's conceivings, freedom from conceivings would not be possible. Cf. my.

[^13]: "...consciousness is to be understood".-MN 43.

[^14]: Simultaneous, superimposed, utterly indifferent to each other.
