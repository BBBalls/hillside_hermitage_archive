<p>As long as one is alive, being subject to some sort of authority or
authorities is inevitable<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. An authority is here meant in a
rather general sense of something or someone who is in a position to
exert influence or control over your behavior or circumstances, in ways
that may be covert or overt.</p>
<p>Most of the time, an authority has to either convince, persuade or
hypnotize us that to follow his rule is indeed what is for our benefit
and is the best thing to do, (so that we do so of our own accord); or
use more subtle ways of making life a bit less agreeable for people who
don’t do so, so that they will modify their behavior as a reflex, but
without being generally aware of why they are doing so. As a last
resort, authorities may turn to brute force. But this is unsustainable
over long periods and with large numbers of people. So generally it is
only used in certain extreme cases (i.e. the inmates of prisons), or
extreme scenarios (war, etc.)</p>
<p>An example of authority benignly doing its job in the first manner
would be something like city councils providing footpaths for people to
walk on in cities, while the rest of the road is designated for cars.
I’ve never heard anyone complaining about the curtailment of their
freedom to walk in whatever part of the road they please. I would bet
that very few people even see this as an imposed structure on their
behavior by an authority, (although it is). The arrangement is simply
taken for granted, for the rather good reason that it factually works.
And there is a generally shared understanding of this.</p>
<p>Obviously, it would be good - ideal - if every form of imposed
structure on people’s behavior by authorities, could be like this; and
would always be something that everyone could comply with willingly and
in full awareness. But what is required for that is that everyone
involved should have a shared understanding of, and agreement on, the
arrangement that will be for the welfare of all; or at least a common
<em>view</em> as to the <em>principles</em> governing such an
arrangement. And this is an impossibility. Even in very small and
specific communities, it is close to impossible, though not
<em>entirely</em> impossible.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>So practically always, at least some of the people will need some
persuading, and even with much persuasion and propaganda, many people
will need a degree of faith that the authority knows what is best for
them better than they themselves do, or they will follow orders with a
degree of skepticism and a degree of reluctance, just for the sake of
not being harassed by the authority or by others.</p>
<p><strong>Owner of your actions</strong></p>
<p>The first important point to understand regarding this is the
following: no authority can make anyone do anything.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>Beings are owners of their actions, heirs of their actions; originate
from their actions, are bound to their actions, and have their actions
as their refuge.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>—MN 135</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nobody else can possibly be responsible for your own deed. All an
authority can do is impose certain consequences for not acting according
to their law; or offer certain rewards for acting according to their
law. They can also (more underhandly) choose to curtail or control
people’s access to information, or use other means to take advantage of
people’s inauthenticity so that although people appear to be doing
something ‘of their own accord’; in truth, almost nobody is genuinely
taking responsibility for their own choice to do such and such thing,
but rather acting out of fear or a sense of duty to do what they are
‘supposed to be doing.’</p>
<p>Or, In the best case, if the authority has some wisdom, they can
clearly and properly set forth, according to proper reasoning, why
acting in such and such a way is for your welfare and benefit, acting in
such and such ways is for your harm and the harm of others; so that you
understand for yourself why it is better to act in this way and can take
responsibility for that choice, without resenting the authority.<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>So to re-emphasize, no authority can make anyone act in a particular
way. All they can do is influence the consequences of acting in one way
or another. Yet, for much of their lives, people end up doing lots of
things - even most things - with the impression of being to some extent
<em>obliged</em> to do them. What this impression practically involves
is the belief that there is <em>no other choice</em>. In truth, though,
there is always another choice to act differently - which will
necessarily have consequences. Some are worse than others.</p>
<p>When somebody cannot bear so much as thinking about certain kinds of
consequences, they habitually shut their eyes to the mere possibility of
a whole range of actions that might provoke such consequences, and
consequently, feel <em>obliged</em> to act in certain ways. (This is
only part of the story, though, because while entertaining the
possibility of an action with very unpleasant consequences is painful
enough, it is still generally not as painful as having to face, time and
time again, the need to make a decision ‘what should I do?’ with the
full weight of that decision lying squarely on one’s own shoulders.)</p>
<p>Being authentic involves refusing to allow yourself any notion of
being obliged to do anything, and taking responsibility for every single
choice you make. This is what will force you to be honest about why you
are choosing one thing and not another. To take a common contemporary
example, if somebody has doubts about a certain vaccine but happens to
have a job for which the vaccine is mandatory, it would be easy for them
to feel that they are being obliged to be vaccinated against their will;
not acknowledging the fact that the choice to act differently is still
open to them, though the consequences of it might be quite unpleasant to
face. An authentic person would be able to reflect, for example, <em>I’m
getting this vaccine because, although I don’t trust that I have at hand
all the relevant information, and I do think I could be taking a risk;
on the whole, I still don’t see this as justifying giving up my job
while having children to support.</em> (It should of course be borne in
mind that this is just one example for illustrative purposes, the reader
may replace it with whatever equivalent example they can think of.)</p>
<p><strong>What is not yours</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps slightly harder to understand, but equally important, is the
point that not only are you solely responsible for your own actions, but
you are responsible for; the owner of, <em>solely</em> your own actions
- <em>nothing else</em>.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been born is subject to all sorts of changes,
disturbances, and troubles that are <em>utterly inaccessible</em> to
their control. The actions of other people, the quality and quantity of
information you have access to, the words of other people, the
conditions of the world; the weather, and the state of health and
decline of your own body - all come under this. In other words, you can
decide what you do; but that choice and the motivation for it is always
strictly internal; there is no way for your choice to access things
beyond it, just as there is no way for other things or people to access
the domain of your own intentional choice.</p>
<p>Specifically, when you make a choice out of wanting to avoid a
certain unpleasant result, or wanting to arrive at a certain pleasant
result, any result that comes about whether it is experienced as
pleasant or unpleasant - is in an entirely different domain. It happens,
so to speak, by itself.</p>
<p>So for instance, in the example above, somebody might say ‘But it’s
not <em>right</em> that they make vaccination mandatory for nurses,
there <em>shouldn’t</em> be this consequence for this kind of choice.’
But these are quite clearly things that belong to others, and that
pertains in fact to an entire domain that doesn’t and cannot belong to
you. Whether other people think and act rightly or wrongly, belongs to
them; what belongs to you are, for instance, the words that you can say
to them, but you can’t give them anything more than the sound of your
voice. Equally, in terms of your own body’s health or sickness, all that
you have is the ability to administer medicine and the possibility to
investigate the causes of disease, but that is as far as it goes.
Whether the medicine works and how it works, belongs to what is
essentially the nature of matter, a different domain that is totally
beyond your ability to access.</p>
<p>Thinking rightly or wrongly depends on the degree to which our
thought corresponds to how things actually are. Whenever people act
wrongly and harmfully, they are trying to exert control and mastery over
things (like other people’s actions) that can’t possibly be controlled
by them.</p>
<p>So an authority can at any time arbitrarily decide to impose
restrictions and strictures on your own daily life whenever they so
choose. If a person is bothered by this, although the change to their
life might be troublesome in itself in various ways, what is truly
bothersome is the fact that it should be possible at all. (That’s when
you hear people saying things like ‘that shouldn’t be allowed… we should
be consulted… there should be some process or other…’ etc.) But this
comes back to why I began with this first point, which is something a
person needs to see for themselves at least to some extent if any of
this is to be comprehensible: to live as a human being (or indeed any
kind of being) is to have <em>some</em> sort of authority over you. Such
that the conditions of your life and the consequences of everyday
actions may be suddenly changed at any moment.</p>
<p>So this bother is a recognition of something much more deep-rooted
and universal, which is this very discrepancy I’m trying to get at:
those things that one naturally takes to be one’s own and holds dear,
are fundamentally <em>not</em> one’s own. (Because if some aspect of
your life may be arbitrarily taken away by some authority or other,
whether for valid reasons or not, then it must necessarily belong more
to the authority than it does to you.)</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">“I have sons, I have wealth.”<br />
Thus the fool frets.<br />
He himself is not his own -.<br />
How then, sons? How then, wealth?</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>—Dhp 62</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being a fundamental bother, pertaining to the nature of things in
general, the only way to overcome it is to address it at this level.
(rather than, say, taking up specific issues with the city council or
what-have-you.)</p>
<p>This is done by, in a nutshell, learning how to stop mistakenly
holding as your own those things which cannot be your own.</p>
<p><strong>How to let go of what isn’t yours.</strong></p>
<p>This phrase, ‘let go of what isn’t yours,’ is repeated many times in
the suttas, and is something that is repeated a lot in Buddhism
generally. The problem is that at least most people if they try to
simply <em>do</em> this directly, will probably end up doing it wrongly.
(The reason being that they would be trying to ‘let go’ of things by way
of the exact same attitude and view with which they were holding those
things from the beginning. In other words, if it were really up to you
whether to let go of something or to keep it, then we wouldn’t have a
problem. The point is to recognize that regardless of whether you let go
or not, the thing was never yours, to begin with.)</p>
<p>That is why I have been emphasizing responsibility: it might seem
paradoxical, but the most practical way to let go of futile suffering is
to <em>first fully</em> accept all the responsibility wherever you
possibly can - and never allow yourself to be obliged to act in any way.
If a person were to genuinely take this as a practice and keep it in
mind throughout everything they were to do, it would naturally become
possible for them to give up the source of this bother (and ultimately
the source of all bother whatsoever.)</p>
<p>One practical example of this at a relatively mundane level would
follow from the one I gave above: if somebody took a vaccine while
feeling obliged to do so, either because of a general sense of duty
despite some misgivings, or even because it was mandatory for them to
keep their job; if they later find out that the authority - who they
deem responsible for <em>making</em> them take the vaccine - had not
been honest, and/or the vaccine turns out to have worse side-effects
than imagined, their mind will then definitely give rise to quite a lot
of anger, frustration, and resentment.</p>
<p>But if somebody took a vaccine while being fully clear and authentic
about their reasons for doing so, aware that they were taking a risk,
and that they were choosing to do so because it was still overall the
better choice rather than the available alternatives - then they might
find out the exact same information, or even undergo some actual
ill-effect of vaccination, but would suffer far less mental disturbance
and turmoil on account of it. Nor would this make them any less capable
of seeing and judging the immorality of the actions of the relevant
authorities.</p>
<p>More generally, if you start correctly seeing the domain of your
responsibility, this will also naturally make you more able to see where
it ends; what is <em>not</em> in your hand and not up to you. This
includes pretty much everything else, most pertinently the things that
happen to you, and whether they are pleasant or unpleasant.</p>
<p>You could then recognize the following very important truth: that
aversion, fear, or really any kind of <em>bother</em> regarding anything
that can arise, is directly maintained by assuming that the painful
thing is the situation, and so trying to deal with it, avoid it, get rid
of it, etc - to get rid of the pain of it. (Incidentally, but
importantly, it’s also maintained by acting on the corresponding
assumption regarding <em>pleasant</em> things, assuming that pleasure is
to be found <em>in</em> a particular experience or situation; so I must
get it, access it, experience it, have it.) In trying to deal with
things on this level, you keep maintaining the notion that you
<em>could</em> have some say in the situation, that you can ‘get at it’.
Which is exactly how you allow things to ‘get at you’.</p>
<p>An image that might help to convey this is a small room, with six
windows or doors, and this room confines you, while you keep trying to
get out of it. But each time you break down one of its windows or doors
or try and go out to the thing you see passing outside, the initial
release quickly reveals itself to be another - slightly smaller -
version of the exact same room.</p>
<p>For as long as you keep trying to escape in that way, you will
maintain the implicit assumption that this sort of escape can provide
release. And you won’t see how your escape attempts are what is making
the room even smaller, the confinement even tighter, nor will it be
possible to see the genuine release. And that is because the genuine
release is not <em>outside</em> of the confinement, but more like a kind
of reconfiguration of your vision so that you can see how the same thing
is not confining at all anymore - precisely because you see that there
is <u>no need</u> to escape in that way, <em>which was never possible to
the begin with</em>.</p>
<p>In practical terms, it comes down, again, to realize that any
suffering at all is never because of the situation, but purely because
of the aversion or craving regarding it: an entirely unnecessary,
futile, and gratuitous thing for which you are directly and solely
responsible. Again, this sentence can be stated theoretically, but it
has to be recognized through truly seeing that which is <em>not up to
you</em>: whatever you do, in a fundamental sense your situation is
always going its own way. It gets better sometimes, it gets worse
sometimes. This would be how you can see that your only responsibility
therein is also what is at the root of all that is painful and suffering
in it, namely the craving, which is maintained <em>by trying to deal
with the situation so as to get rid of the pain of it</em>. And if you
were to see this you could let go of it, which is when you would not
suffer albeit amidst the same circumstances that would previously have
caused you much suffering.</p>
<p><strong>The extremity</strong></p>
<p>It might be asked whether there is any limit to this principle. - I
have said ‘no matter what the situation’; is this a figure of speech
that in some extreme scenario no longer holds true? The answer is that
there are no limits whatsoever to how far it <em>can</em> be taken,
depending on how seriously one takes the fundamental problem of one’s
life and the degree of effort one is prepared to dedicate to the task of
overcoming it. The suttas give many rather extreme examples of people
who, having developed their minds along such lines, do not experience
anguish, even amidst the worst kinds of suffering. My favorite is the
story of a laywoman called ‘Nanda’s mother,’ who recounts the
following:</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>I had an only son called Nanda who was dear and pleasing to me. The
rulers forcibly abducted him on some pretext and had him executed. But
when my son was under arrest or being arrested, imprisoned or being put
in prison, killed or being killed, I cannot recall any change in the
state of my mind.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>—AN 7.53</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This might seem initially like a totally incomprehensible or
impossible feat, only explicable by some sort of mystical or magical
transformation of a person into some sort of robot. (And many Buddhists
do end up taking it like this, though they might not admit it). But it
is simply the result of the same principle as we have been describing
being applied and developed to its full extent.</p>
<p>From a slightly different angle, if one takes responsibility for
choosing to live in the domain of a certain authority that one considers
to be oppressive, then the first natural reaction is to search for a
different place where there will be a less oppressive authority in
charge. But still, as I said, one will have to live under some authority
or another; and this principle has no limit: here is a passage from the
suttas spoken by Mara, who in the suttas is a deity who holds the
position of a top bureaucrat over the system of samsara, (by which he is
equally fully bound).</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>“The eye is mine, ascetic, forms are mine, eye-contact and its base
of consciousness are mine. Where can you go, ascetic, to escape from me?
The ear is mine, ascetic, sounds are mine … The nose is mine, ascetic,
odors are mine … The tongue is mine, ascetic, tastes are mine … The body
is mine, ascetic, tactile objects are mine … The mind is mine, ascetic,
mental phenomena are mine, mind-contact and its base of consciousness
are mine. Where can you go, ascetic, to escape from me?”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>—SN 4.19</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another sense, pertinently, Mara is also called the King of Death,
and this could be taken in a very literal sense. To be in the realm of
Mara is to be subject to old age and death. That is what holds sway over
the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. That is the ultimate
authority. And the escape from it is still the same.</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">“That of which they say ‘It’s mine,’<br />
And those who speak in terms of ‘mine’—<br />
If your mind exists among these,<br />
You won’t escape me, ascetic.”<br />
<br />
The Blessed One:<br />
“That which they speak of is not mine,<br />
I’m not one of those who speak of mine.<br />
You should know thus, O Evil One:<br />
Even my path you will not see.”</div>
</blockquote>

<li id="fn2"><p>The requirement is pretty much that such a community
should be a community of noble disciples; i.e. people who possess the
Right View, one of the characteristics of which is ‘seeing right as
right and wrong as wrong’; another characteristic being that all not
only have the same goal - liberation from birth, death and suffering-
but the same understanding of how to achieve that goal. Note that this
is absolutely NOT the same as a cult, in which people voluntarily deny
their own individual point of view in favour of that of the group and
the leader - in this, rather, each person has individually come to an
understanding of certain fundamental principles that are timeless and
universal, and each of them are individually also defined as
‘independent of others.’ Unlike a cult, for such individuals it is
irrelevant whether they are alone or in a group, aside from practical
convenience and similar considerations. But because their understanding
pertains to something universal, they will naturally be ‘on the same
page’ at least as far as important things go, without needing very much
in the way of micro-managed rules to govern their behavior.<a

not think of himself as an authority over the monks.</p>

the Perfected One does not think in this way.)</p>
