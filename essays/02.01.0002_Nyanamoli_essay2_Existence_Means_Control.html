<p>In order for something to exist (<em>bhava</em>), in order for it to
be, in a full and appropriated sense, that thing has to be given first,
in the form of an experience as a whole. When I say ‘given’, this should
be understood in the sense that we can only “find” things as already
being there, in the world. (Cf. Sartre’s statement in <em>Being &amp;
Nothingness</em> that every thing comes <em>with</em> past). The fact is
that things can only be found when they are attended to and this means
that – fundamentally speaking – they are <em>beyond</em> one’s control<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>: one is not their <em>creator</em>.
Thus, one’s experience as a whole <em>cannot</em> be controlled; the
most a person can do is to modify an already given state of affairs, on
a more particular level.</p>
<p>Take the five-aggregates as an example: their nature is to appear,
disappear, and change while standing, at <em>their own accord</em>. It
is only with <em>upādāna</em> that this characteristic is obscured<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and in such cases the apparent Self
becomes the fundamental agent of the process instead, or at least this
is how it appears to a <em>puthujjana</em>. One who is not free from
<em>upādāna</em>, and the Self-view, confuses the fact that the
five-aggregates (or in this case the five-holding-aggregates)
<em>can</em> be modified or affected once they arise, with the notion
that they are controlled. This notion of control also supports (or
feeds) the view that ‘Self’ is their creator, which in return feeds that
notion, and so on indefinitely. This is why with ‘Self’ there comes the
perception of <em>mastery</em> over one’s experience – <em>“Attā</em>,
‘self’, is fundamentally a notion of <em>mastery over things</em>.”
(Ñāṇavīra Thera, <em>Notes on Dhamma</em>, DHAMMA)</p>
<p>The Self then, as a “master”, appears as something different,
something <em>apart</em> from the five-holding-aggregates. Furthermore,
the Self keeps finding proof for its existence by constantly interfering
and modifying (when possible) the arisen states of the
five-holding-aggregates. The Self finds pleasure in doing so.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the Self would see that, despite all of the
proof, its mastery actually <em>requires</em> (or <em>directly
depends</em> upon) the five-aggregates, the notion of control would
cease<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. It becomes clear that ‘Self’ cannot
possibly exercise any fundamental control over their appearing,
disappearing, and change while standing. This is why by contemplating
this long enough, one can become an <em>arahat</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Then, monks, at another time the Buddha Vipassī dwelt contemplating
the appearing and disappearing of the five-holding-aggregates… And as he
remained contemplating the appearing and disappearing of the
five-holding-aggregates, before long his mind was freed from the fetters
without remainder.”</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Even if one can control them, first they have to be. In
other words – the nature of control is seen as something beyond our
control.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn2"><p>As a matter of fact, it’s not only the characteristic
that is obscured, the five-aggregates are not seen either, most of the
time.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn3"><p>For a puthujjana it is not enough to see this once. It
is only with the repetition of this insight (achieved through effort),
that the habitual view of control will disappear, and be replaced
(gradually too) with the view of an inherent lack of control – the view
of impermanence. When it is seen that impermanence underlies every
project of the Self, the Self ceases to be Self, since without its
mastery, selfhood cannot stand. (Cf. Ñāṇavīra Thera, Notes on Dhamma,
PARAMATTHA SACCA, para. 6)<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"
