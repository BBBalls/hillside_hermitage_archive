<blockquote>
<p>“Bright, monks, is the mind. It is superimposed by the defiling
obstructions. The uninstructed worldling does not know this. For the
uninstructed worldling, therefore, there is no development of mind.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><em>Pabhassaram</em>—this could be translated as ‘bright’, and it
should be regarded as something lit up, shining, effulgent or
<em>lucid</em>. To find out how this term should be understood, one can
bring to mind the term <em>ākāsa</em>—space—which literally means
‘shining forth’, in the sense of a space which is lit up. In MN 49, we
can see that consciousness is referred to as <em>viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ
anantaṃ sabbato pabhaṃ,</em> where ‘non-indicative’, ‘infinite’ (or
endless, limitless) and ‘completely radiant’ (i.e. utterly and
fundamentally lucid, not to be understood in a sense of mystically
beaming rays of light or similar), are the terms referring to
<em>viññāṇa</em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The whole point is that ‘brightness’
is an epithet describing the inherently <em>infinite structure</em> of
the mind, which is ‘defiled’ by the obstructions (i.e. made
<em>finite</em>). In SN 35.202 the Buddha said:</p>
<div class="english">
<blockquote>
<p>How, friends, does one not leak? Here, friends, having seen form with
eye, a monk does not incline towards pleasing forms, he is not affected
by displeasing forms. He lives aware of the body there and with mind
that is boundless.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>A monk can dwell and live his life with a “boundless mind”.<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> He has understood the
nature of the body <em>there</em> together with the arisen structure of
the present experience,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> which is infinite. By understanding
the infinite or boundless, any boundaries and finiteness that were
present as a result of that lack of understanding, are removed. In other
words, the ‘brightness’ or ‘lucidity’ or ‘infinity’ or ‘boundlessness’
are the ways of describing the <em>property</em> of the fundamental
structure of experience, which is the very reason why overcoming the
obstructions is possible.</p>
<p><em>Āgantuka</em>—here it is translated as ‘superimposed’. It can
also mean adventitious, incidental, accessory. The main point that has
to be borne in mind is that the ‘obstructions’ are “incidental”, in the
sense that they are not caused by the <em>pabhassaramidaṃ cittaṃ,</em>
but are nevertheless there. The defiling obstructions do not have
anything in common with the brightness of the mind; they are simply
“layered” there, superimposed without actually affecting the infinite
structure. Thus, since the infinite mind does not need those
obstructions, it can be rightly said that they are completely
gratuitous.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>So, obstructions, or more precisely <em>avijjā</em>, have no
<em>first point</em> when they are manifested before which mind was
pure, bright and unpolluted. Because of this it is not correct to refer
to ‘bright mind’ as an <em>original thing</em>, as if it existed in a
pure state <em>before</em> the obstructions arrived. Since there is no
beginning to the infinity, nor to the beginningless <em>avijjā</em>, the
notions of “first this, then that” have no place to apply. So how shall
this evident priority of the ‘bright mind’ be understood then? The
answer is straight—in an atemporal, structural sense. The infinity of
the mind precedes <em>avijjā</em> ontologically, so to speak, while they
are there both, <em>simultaneously present.</em> This should also shed
some light onto why the structure of the mind does not imply nor require
the obstructions (hence they are called ‘obstructions’)—they are
superfluous, unnecessary, superimposed. Yet, the <em>uppakilesā</em> are
there, and are not to be found elsewhere.<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> To
put this all in different words: the infinity of one’s mind is a
temporally more fundamental than one’s own nescience in regard to it.
Furthermore, it is because of the nescience in regard to the <em>nature
of infinity</em>, that <em>avijjā</em> is <em>a beginningless</em>
<em>phenomenon</em>. If infinity has no beginning, how could the
fundamental ignorance of that be different?</p>
<p>This is not all, there are further implications of one’s ignorance of
the infinite structure—namely, <em>permanence.</em> The uninstructed
worldling confuses the notion of infinity (no beginning, no end) with
the notion of <em>eternity</em>, or rather <em>identifies</em> the two.
In this way, a present experience is regarded as eternal or permanent.
What a <em>puthujjana</em> does not see is that eternity implies
infinity, but the infinity does not imply eternity.<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
Because of the nescience in regard to this, the <em>puthujjana’s</em>
experience of infinity <em>assumes</em> permanence. In other words, his
<em>citta</em> is regarded as permanent; he regards his Self as
permanent. If one would be able to see the infinity without eternity, or
even to see it as impermanent, the notion of Self, and everything else
that depended upon it, (which required the notion of permanence), would
cease without a remainder. Knowing infinity as something present
(i.e. arisen) but impermanent (for the very reason that it has
<em>arisen</em> on its own accord), clears the mind of any obstructions,
any superimposed interferences with the infinite structure. Hence it is
said that the <em>arahant’s</em> mind is <em>immeasurable.</em><a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> His <em>citta</em> has been
developed to the structurally more fundamental state, and it is because
this state was always <em>possible</em> (but not <em>actual</em>)<a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> that transcending the obstructions
was feasible. In other words, if one’s mind was <em>inherently</em>
ignorant—i.e. <em>avijjā</em> structurally preceded any
experience—arahantship would not be possible. (See footnote <a
href="#fn61">[61]</a> above).<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"

<li id="fn1"><p>Ñāṇavīra Thera took sabbatopabhaṃ to be sabbato-apahaṃ
(from apahoti, a+pahoti), in which case this compound would be
synonymous with anidassanaṃ, ‘non-indicative’ or ‘not-producing’ (Self).
(Cf. Ñāṇavīra Thera—Clearing the Path (2010), ‘Note on
Paṭiccasamuppāda’, footnote j, p.28). Whether he was right or wrong in
reading it like this, it is clear here that either way the context is
scarcely affected—the infinity of consciousness does not indicate Self,
does not produce Self, and it is fundamentally lucid, radiant, and
unobstructed.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

beginningless) parasite on the intentional structure described here, and
its necessity is not to be deduced from the necessity of intention in
all experience. Intention does not imply craving—a hard thing to
understand! But if intention did imply craving, arahatta would be out of
the question, and there would be no escape.”—Ñāṇavīra Thera, op. cit.,

<li id="fn7"><p>The reader might notice that Ñāṇavīra Thera in
‘Fundamental Structure’ (op.cit. p. 107) refers to the endurance of a
thing as ‘eternal’. This structural ‘eternity’ is what is meant here by
‘infinity’. It is just how one decides to designate these terms. If we
were to choose the term ‘eternal’ to describe the property of the
structure, we would additionally have to qualify it by saying: “A thing
endures for ever. A thing is eternal… until it ceases.” I, personally,
prefer ‘infinite’ so that the distinction between the inherent nature of
the arisen experience (infinity) becomes apparent from the puthujjana’s
appropriation of it (eternity).<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back"
