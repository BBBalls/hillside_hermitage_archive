<p>“Bright, monks, is the mind. It is superimposed by the defiling

uninstructed worldling, therefore, there is no development of mind.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><span lang="pi"><em>Pabhassaram</em></span>—this could be translated
as ‘bright’, and it should be regarded as something lit up, shining,
effulgent or <em>lucid</em>. To find out how this term should be
understood, one can bring to mind the term <span
lang="pi"><em>ākāsa</em></span>—space—which literally means ‘shining
forth’, in the sense of a space which is lit up. In <cite>MN 49</cite>,
we can see that consciousness is referred to as <span
lang="pi"><em>viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ anantaṃ sabbato pabhaṃ</em></span>,
where ‘non-indicative’, ‘infinite’ (or endless, limitless) and
‘completely radiant’ (i.e. utterly and fundamentally lucid, not to be
understood in a sense of mystically beaming rays of light or similar),
are the terms referring to <span lang="pi"><em>viññāṇa</em></span>.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The whole point is that ‘brightness’
is an epithet describing the inherently <em>infinite structure</em> of
the mind, which is ‘defiled’ by the obstructions (i.e. made
<em>finite</em>). In <cite>SN 35.202</cite> the Buddha said:</p>
<div lang="en">
<blockquote>
<p>How, friends, does one not leak? Here, friends, having seen form with
eye, a monk does not incline towards pleasing forms, he is not affected
by displeasing forms. He lives aware of the body there and with mind
that is boundless.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>A monk can dwell and live his life with a “boundless mind”.<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> He has understood the
nature of the body <em>there</em> together with the arisen structure of
the present experience,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> which is infinite. By understanding
the infinite or boundless, any boundaries and finiteness that were
present as a result of that lack of understanding, are removed. In other
words, the ‘brightness’ or ‘lucidity’ or ‘infinity’ or ‘boundlessness’
are the ways of describing the <em>property</em> of the fundamental
structure of experience, which is the very reason why overcoming the
obstructions is possible.</p>
<p><span lang="pi"><em>Āgantuka</em></span>—here it is translated as
‘superimposed’. It can also mean adventitious, incidental, accessory.
The main point that has to be borne in mind is that the ‘obstructions’
are “incidental”, in the sense that they are not caused by the <span
lang="pi"><em>pabhassaramidaṃ cittaṃ</em></span>, but are nevertheless
there. The defiling obstructions do not have anything in common with the
brightness of the mind; they are simply “layered” there, superimposed
without actually affecting the infinite structure. Thus, since the
infinite mind does not need those obstructions, it can be rightly said
that they are completely gratuitous.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>So, obstructions, or more precisely <span
lang="pi"><em>avijjā</em></span>, have no <em>first point</em> when they
are manifested before which mind was pure, bright and unpolluted.
Because of this it is not correct to refer to ‘bright mind’ as an
<em>original thing</em>, as if it existed in a pure state
<em>before</em> the obstructions arrived. Since there is no beginning to
the infinity, nor to the beginningless <span
lang="pi"><em>avijjā</em></span>, the notions of “first this, then that”
have no place to apply. So how shall this evident priority of the
‘bright mind’ be understood then? The answer is straight—in an
atemporal, structural sense. The infinity of the mind precedes <span
lang="pi"><em>avijjā</em></span> ontologically, so to speak, while they
are there both, <em>simultaneously present.</em> This should also shed
some light onto why the structure of the mind does not imply nor require
the obstructions (hence they are called ‘obstructions’)—they are
superfluous, unnecessary, superimposed. Yet, the <span
lang="pi"><em>uppakilesā</em></span> are there, and are not to be found
elsewhere.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> To put this all in different words:
the infinity of one’s mind is a temporally more fundamental than one’s
own nescience in regard to it. Furthermore, it is because of the
nescience in regard to the <em>nature of infinity</em>, that
<em>avijjā</em> is <em>a beginningless phenomenon</em>. If infinity has
no beginning, how could the fundamental ignorance of that be
different?</p>
<p>This is not all, there are further implications of one’s ignorance of
the infinite structure—namely, <em>permanence</em>. The uninstructed
worldling confuses the notion of infinity (no beginning, no end) with
the notion of <em>eternity</em>, or rather <em>identifies</em> the two.
In this way, a present experience is regarded as eternal or permanent.
What a <span lang="pi"><em>puthujjana</em></span> does not see is that
eternity implies infinity, but the infinity does not imply eternity.<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Because of the nescience in regard
to this, the <span lang="pi"><em>puthujjana’s</em></span> experience of
infinity <em>assumes</em> permanence. In other words, his <span
lang="pi"><em>citta</em></span> is regarded as permanent; he regards his
Self as permanent. If one would be able to see the infinity without
eternity, or even to see it as impermanent, the notion of Self, and
everything else that depended upon it, (which required the notion of
permanence), would cease without a remainder. Knowing infinity as
something present (i.e. arisen) but impermanent (for the very reason
that it has <em>arisen</em> on its own accord), clears the mind of any
obstructions, any superimposed interferences with the infinite
structure. Hence it is said that the <span
lang="pi"><em>arahant’s</em></span> mind is <em>immeasurable.</em><a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> His <em>citta</em> has been
developed to the structurally more fundamental state, and it is because
this state was always <em>possible</em> (but not <em>actual</em>)<a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> that transcending the obstructions
was feasible. In other words, if one’s mind was <em>inherently</em>
ignorant—i.e. <span lang="pi"><em>avijjā</em></span> structurally
preceded any experience—arahantship would not be possible. <a

to be <span lang="pi">sabbato-apahaṃ</span> (from <span

case this compound would be synonymous with anidassanaṃ,
‘non-indicative’ or ‘not-producing’ (Self). (Cf. Ñāṇavīra
Thera—<cite>Clearing the Path</cite> (2010), ‘Note on Paṭiccasamuppāda’,
footnote j, p.28). Whether he was right or wrong in reading it like
this, it is clear here that either way the context is scarcely
affected—the infinity of consciousness does not indicate Self, does not
produce Self, and it is fundamentally lucid, radiant, and
unobstructed.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

‘Fundamental Structure’ (op.cit. p. 107) refers to the endurance of a
thing as ‘eternal’. This structural ‘eternity’ is what is meant here by
‘infinity’. It is just how one decides to designate these terms. If we
were to choose the term ‘eternal’ to describe the property of the
structure, we would additionally have to qualify it by saying: “A thing
endures for ever. A thing is eternal… until it ceases.” I, personally,
prefer ‘infinite’ so that the distinction between the inherent nature of
the arisen experience (infinity) becomes apparent from the <span
