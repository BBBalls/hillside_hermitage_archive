### Making Peace With Feeling

By making peace with what is felt, one is developing *metta* or non-ill
will. By that I mean, no longer interfering with what is felt, by no
longer trying to change it, but by withstanding it, by not craving it,
by fully comprehending it.

When you feel pleasure, your default mode is to try and keep it, you
want it to stay, you try to increase it because it does not feel
adequate, there is something about it that just isn't satisfying you,
yet it is 'pleasure', it is already enough of what it is in itself. In
other words, pleasure is not good enough for you, you crave for it to be
more, to last longer, and so on.

Your delighting in pleasure will not make you content, because it's an
agitated attempt to keep pleasure, it's a holding on to something which
is not yours and impossible to make your own. Such an act is not only
lustful but also aversive and ignorant, an act of wanting things to be
the way you want them to be and not the way they are.

When you feel pain, your default mode is to try to get rid of it, to
decrease it. Yet it is the way it is and your attempt to change it is
again not peaceful, it's not kind, not compassionate, not content, not
equanimous. You don't want pain so you seek pleasure but when you get
it, still you are not satisfied. After all, it can never be yours. Your
gratuitous attitude of craving can never be satisfied no matter what you
put in front of it. Its nature is to be unfulfilled.

You want the pain to change and you want pleasure not to change. You
want *anicca* and you don't want *anicca*. Wanting *anicca* is wanting
*dukkha*. This wanting or interfering with feeling which changes is
maintaining your liability to be affected by feeling, which means you
will never be peaceful, your mind will be dragged around with feeling in
whichever way it goes. This wanting and touching feeling means that you
will always be affected by it. In other words, you love when it's
pleasant and hate when it's unpleasant. You are on and will continue to
be on an emotional rollercoaster because you take feelings personally,
you are holding them.

By detaching from a feeling through understanding its nature, and by no
longer touching it with your attitude of wanting/craving, by way of not
acting out of intentions based on greed, hate, or delusion, the feeling
will not affect you anymore, you will be unable to love and therefore
unable to hate. Your mental state will be brought to equilibrium, peace,
and *upekkha*.

The reason I am emphasizing having the attitude of *metta* towards what
is felt is because it's a refined act of non-craving, which if
sustained, will eventually result in there being no possibility of
hating anyone, because the only reason you find another person or
situation irritating to the point of hatred, is because you hate the
pain that has arisen and you long for the pleasure that is forever out
of your control.

[**Love or non-hate.**]{.underline}

The problem that you can encounter if you think the *metta* practice
taught in the suttas by the Buddha, is the practice of love, is that you
will continue to delight in pleasure dependent on the senses, which
means you will also hate or be irritated when there is not enough of it.
The degree to which you love is the degree to which you can hate.

*Metta* is not about love but non-hate. It's a quality that a great
friend has. They can never hate you because they cannot love you. They
are not emotionally dependent on feelings, their minds are undisturbed,
peaceful, and therefore can be of great benefit to another who is
clouded by love and hate or affected by feelings. No matter what you do,
they see clearly when you do not. Their benevolence, their *metta* is
"unconditioned".

*Metta* when fully developed becomes *upekkha*, complete peaceful
detachment, and that cannot come about when you are doing something
which is not peaceful, like fighting or even delighting in pleasure
desperately holding on to it so that it doesn't change. That is not the
path of peace or renunciation.

Renunciation of pleasure means not interfering with it, renunciation of
pain means not interfering with it. Renunciation means non-craving.

When there is pain practice *metta* towards that. When there is
pleasure, practice *metta* towards that, not wanting it to stay or
change, i.e. unconditional friendliness.

If you want to practice *metta* for the uprooting of the cause of
suffering, then you must let go of the feeling, let it be what it is,
patiently withstand it, without interfering, and then you will be in a
good position to see its nature, which is *agitating*. All feeling
agitates and by holding on to it, by touching it, you are agitated,
sometimes a lot as with pain or only a little as with pleasure, either
way, feeling is an agitation. You can then realize that there is no such
thing as pleasure, there are only different degrees of pain, and all
this time, what you thought was pleasure was just less pain, and due to
that assumption you held on to it as yours, as yourself, and thus were
affected by its agitated nature.

The more you let go of your craving regarding a feeling the less it will
affect you and the more peaceful/*upekkha* you become. This means that
no matter what happens in life, no matter how much pain is 'caused to
you by another being', you will be peaceful, and you will not be able to
get angry, hateful, or irritated. Your mind will be a *brahmavihara*/a
heavenly place because you removed the cause of love and hate from it.
